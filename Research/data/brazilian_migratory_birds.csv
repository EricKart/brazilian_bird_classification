6,Anatidae,,MGT,,,,,
7,Anatidae,Anas sibilatrix,MGT,marreca-oveira,Chiloe Wigeon,,," endemic to South America, breeding in southern Argentina, central Chile and on the Malvinas/Falkland Islands (Chesser, 1994; Sick, 1997). Populations that breed in the southern part of the distribution migrate to lower latitudes during austral winter and reach southern Brazil (Carboneras, 1992a). In Brazil, there are records of few individuals, which suggest that it is a marginal population that possibly represents less than 1% of the global population (ARA, 2016). For Rio Grande do Sul (RS) there are records in June and August (Maur�cio & Dias, 1996) and isolated records in October, February and July (Belton, 1984). Photographic records are restricted to September and October for RS and to September for S�o Paulo (SP) (WikiAves, 2016)."
8,Anatidae,Anas discors,MGT,marreca-de-asa-azul,Blue-winged Teal,,," breeds in North America from southern Alaska to central USA and the Gulf Coast. It spends the boreal winter in part of the USA, the Antilles, the Bahamas, Central America and northern South America, including northern Brazil (Carboneras & Kirwan, 2016). In late August it reaches the floodplains of Maraj� Island/Par� (PA) and lowlands of Maranh�o (MA) (Antas, 1987) probably in non-stop flights originating from its breeding sites. Juveniles banded in Canada and the USA (n = 93) between July and September were recovered in the Brazilian states of Acre (AC), PA, MA, Piau� (PI), Cear� (CE), Rio Grande do Norte (RN), Para�ba (PB), Minas Gerais (MG) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) between December and February (Mestre et al., 2010; MZUSP 42153 [PA, 1959, January]). In addition, there are records between January and March for Roraima (RR), Amazonas (AM), PA and MA (Azevedo-J�nior, 2007; WikiAves, 2016). However, there are also records for RJ between April and August (Sick, 1997; MZUSP 78523 [1966, May]), as well as for SP (Silva-e-Silva & Olmos, 2007; WikiAves, 2016). For Paran� (PR) (Vallejos et al., 2011) and RS, where it appears to beVAGrant, there are records only in November (Belton, 1978). However, the occurrence of this species outside northern Brazil is occasional and irregular."
9,Anatidae,Oxyura vittata,MGT,marreca-rabo-de-espinho,Lake Duck,,," occurs in Chile, Argentina and southern Brazil. Populations that breed to the south of the distribution migrate north during winter, especially from April to August, and reach RS and Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) (Carboneras, 1992). In Brazil, this species occurs from January to July in RS, from January to May in Santa Catarina (SC), in February and March in PR and in July in MS (SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP 2415 [RS, 1894, April])."
10,Phoenicopteridae,,MGT,,,,,
11,Phoenicopteridae,Phoenicopterus chilensis,MGT,flamingo-chileno,Chilean Flamingo,NT,," occurs from central western Ecuador to the south, through the Andes, as far as Tierra del Fuego, and to the east reaching southern Brazil and Uruguay (del Hoyo et al., 2016a). It breeds in the region of Buenos Aires and C�rdoba provinces in Argentina and migrates east towards the coastal lagoons in southern Brazil and Uruguay (Antas, 1994), reaching the Lagoa do Peixe/RS, where they are recorded in large numbers from April to September (Belton, 1984; Sick, 1997; Bencke et al., 2006). There is no evidence of breeding activity in Brazil, but photographic records suggest that the species is present all year round in RS (WikiAves, 2016), possibly represented by non-breeding individuals that are immature and remain in the state until they reach breeding age (FZBRS, 2013). There are records of this species for PR only in October, for SP between June and January, and for RJ specifically in April, June, September, November and December (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP 101724 [SP, 2016, January]; MNRJ 39058 [RJ, 1994, June])."
12,Spheniscidae,,MGT,,,,,
13,Spheniscidae,Spheniscus magellanicus,MGT,pinguim,Magellanic Penguin,NT,," occurs in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. It departs from its breeding site in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego in April and migrates at each austral winter to the mouth of the Plata River, Uruguayan coast and southern and southeastern Brazil north to the state of RJ (Sick, 1997; ICMBio, 2010). It reaches Brazil in mid-May and departs from the coast in September (Antas, 1987). It isVAGrant in northeastern Brazil and records in this region have been increasing (Mart�nez, 1992), which suggests that this region is an extension of the wintering area of the species, especially since 2008 (Dantas et al., 2013). Photografic and museum records endorse a major Brazilian occurence of the species in the period between June and December from RS until RJ. Outside this period there are few isolated records to RJ, SC and RS (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MNRJ)."
14,Diomedeidae,,MGT,,,,,
15,Diomedeidae,Thalassarche chlororhynchos,MGT,albatroz-de-nariz-amarelo,Yellow-nosed Albatross,EN,EN," breeds on the group of islands of Tristan da Cunha (Tristan da Cunha, Inaccessible, Nightingale, Middle and Stoltenhoff) and Gough Island (Olmos et al., 2006). In Brazilian waters it occurs more frequently from RS to RJ (MZUSP; MNRJ). However, there are records from northeastern Brazil (Olmos et al., 2006), for Sergipe (SE) in June, Alagoas (AL) in May and June (Sousa et al., 2005; MNRJ 36008 [AL, 1988, May]), Pernambuco (PE) in May (Carlos et al., 2005a), MA in October (Carvalho et al., 2010) and even in PA, in Muan�, in July (WikiAves, 2016). During winter, the number of individuals in oceanic Brazilian waters rises considerably (Neves et al., 2006). Individuals banded at breeding sites were recovered in the states of SP in September, SC in June (Olmos, 2002a) and RS in November (Soto & Riva, 2001)."
16,Diomedeidae,Thalassarche melanophris,MGT,albatroz-de-sobrancelha,Black-browed Albatross,NT,," occurs on Southern seas from Cape Horn east to Antipodes Islands and from Campbell Islands south to New Zealand (Carboneras, 1992b). Its breeding season extends from September to April in the Malvinas/Falkland Islands, where the largest breeding colonies of this species are located (Neves et al., 2006) and where most individuals that visit Brazil originate from (ACAP, 2009). Nestlings (n = 52) banded on the Malvinas/Falkland Islands were recovered between May and September along the Brazilian coast, most of them south of Arraial do Cabo/RJ (Olmos, 1997), which suggests that the species is more common � though not exclusive � during winter in latitudes superior to 21�S (Olmos, 2002a). These recoveries, alongside sightings in open sea, suggest that records of this species in the southern coast of Brazil are mainly of juveniles (Olmos, 1997) that use the waters over the Brazilian continental shelf as feeding areas (Piacentini et al., 2005). Museum records also confirm the species� presence on the Brazilian coast mainly between May and September at RJ, SP, SC e RS (MZUSP; MNRJ)."
17,Diomedeidae,Thalassarche cauta,MGT,albatroz-arisco,White-capped Albatross,NT,," occurs in Tasmania and Auckland Islands, Crozet, Snares, Bounty and Chatham (Carboneras, 1992b) and breeds only on three islands south of Australia: Albatross, Pedra Branca and Mewstone (ACAP, 2009). They also occur in the western South Atlantic, where they are bycatch in pelagic longline fishing in Brazil and Uruguay (Gianuca et al., 2011). It occurs regularly in Brazilian waters, on the continental slope region along RS and SC, since juveniles were recorded in open sea between May and September from 2005 to 2011, one adult in August 2011 (Gianuca et al., 2011) and one photographic record in October for RS (WikiAves, 2016). There is also one record in PR, although the month is not mentioned (Scherer-Neto et al., 2011). Besides these, two other Brazilian specimens remain to be identified (D�nes et al., 2007): one from RS collected in April (Petry et al., 1991) and another from Bahia (BA) in September (Lima et al., 2004a). In this paper we follow CBRO (Piacentini et al., 2015). However, recent data reveals that there is no confirmed record of Thalassarche cauta in the Southwestern Atlantic, but of Thalassarche steadi instead, suggesting review of these seabirds identification as necessary (Gianuca et al., 2011; Seco-Pon & Tamini, 2013; Jim�nez et al., 2015)."
18,Diomedeidae,Diomedea epomophora,MGT,albatroz-real,Royal Albatross,VU,VU," occurs in southern seas and breeds in New Zealand, in the Auckland Islands (99% of the population) and Campbell (ACAP, 2009) from November to March (Neves et al., 2006). After breeding, it migrates across the Pacific and Cape Horn to feed on the continental shelf of Argentina (including the Malvinas/Falklands) and southern Brazil, where it remains for months before migrating back across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans (Olmos, 2002a; Neves et al., 2006). One chick banded in New Zealand in October 1976 was found dead almost one year later in RS, in August (Sick, 1997). Two specimens captured in RS in July and August were banded in Campbell (Olmos, 2002a) and there are records in April, August, September and November for Rio Grande/ RS (WikiAves, 2016). the continental shelf of Argentina (including the Malvinas/Falklands) and southern Brazil, where it remains for months before migrating back across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans (Olmos, 2002a; Neves et al., 2006). One chick banded in New Zealand in October 1976 was found dead almost one year later in RS, in August (Sick, 1997). Two specimens captured in RS in July and August were banded in Campbell (Olmos, 2002a) and there are records in April, August, September and November for Rio Grande/ RS (WikiAves, 2016)."
19,Diomedeidae,Diomedea sanfordi,MGT,albatroz-real-do-norte,Northern Royal Albatross,EN,EN," breeds in New Zealand, only in the Chatham Islands and the Otago Peninsula (Taiaroa Head) (Olmos et al., 2006) from September to April. After breeding, it migrates east to the coast of Chile and Peru, where it molts. It then goes around Cape Horn to reach the continental shelf of Argentina (including the Malvinas/Falklands) and southern Brazil before crossing the Atlantic Ocean via the South African coast and migrating through the Austral Ocean to its breeding site (Neves et al., 2006). For RS there are photographic records in the months of May, August (Bencke et al., 2010) and October (WikiAves, 2016) and also as bycatch in the longline fishing fleet of Brazil in August (Carlos et al., 2004a). For SC there is only one record in July 2001 away from the continental shelf (Olmos, 2002b)."
20,Diomedeidae,Diomedea exulans,MGT,albatroz-errante,Wandering Albatross,VU,CR," occurs across most of the Austral Ocean, from the Antarctic Circle (68�S) to the Tropic of Capricorn (23�S). It breeds in the South Georgia Islands on the Atlantic Ocean, mainly on Bird Island. It also breeds on Prince Edward and Marion Islands, Crozet and Kerguelen Islands, and Macquarie Island, which belongs to South Africa, France and Australia respectively. This species has a long reproductive period (55 weeks) and individuals that nest in the Atlantic migrate east reaching the south coast of Australia and the Pacific Ocean (Neves et al., 2006). Individuals (n = 12), mostly nestlings, banded on Bird Island/South Georgia in October were recovered in Brazil mainly in July and September, on the coast of RS or in open sea in RS and SP (Mestre et al., 2010)."
21,Diomedeidae,Diomedea dabbenena,MGT,albatroz-de-trist�o,Tristan Albatross,CR,CR," occurs in the central South Atlantic Ocean and it currently breeds only on Gough and Inaccessible Islands, since it is extinct in Tristan da Cunha (Olmos, 2008). Geolocation data suggests that 14 non-breeding adults used the southwestern Atlantic during the austral summer and migrated to the southeastern Atlantic and Indian Ocean to the east as far as Australia during the austral winter (Reid et al., 2013). Two male specimens banded on Gough Island in January and October were bycatch in longline fishing in Brazil in RS in October and November, respectively (Neves & Olmos, 2001). Records in Brazilian waters for SP (August), SC (November) and RS (October, November) suggest that the species is more frequent in waters under the influence of the Subtropical Convergence away from the coast of RS (Neves & Olmos, 2001). Museum records date for SC in September and RS in June, September and October (MZUSP specimens)."
23,Procellariidae,,MGT,,,,,
24,Procellariidae,Macronectes giganteus,MGT,petrel-grande,Southern Giant-Petrel,,," has a circumpolar distribution on southern seas and breeds from October to March in Antarctica and on islands from Chile to Argentina east through subantarctic islands to Heard and Macquarie Islands (Carboneras, 1992c; Olmos et al., 2006; Grantsau, 2010). Adults move only through waters that are adjacent to colonies, but the young perform circumpolar migration across the southern ocean when leaving the nest, with mainly westerly winds, before returning to the colony (Olmos, 2002a; Olmos et al., 2006). Birds banded as chicks and/or juveniles in South Georgia (Bird Island), South Orkney Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula between January and March were recovered in Brazil between June and October in the states of RJ, SC and RS (Olmos, 2002a). Brazilian museum records confirm that pattern from specimens collected in RJ in July (MNRJ) and from SP in June and SC in July (MZUSP). Nestlings (n = 10) banded between January and March on Elephant Island were mostly recovered in RS, but also in SC, PR, SP and RJ between June and November and in the Atol das Rocas/RN in February (SNA, 2016). There is one other recovery in Brazil in June without a known locality, which is of a chick banded in Australia in January (Sick, 1997). In addition, there are records of juveniles for RJ, SP, SC and RS between March and November (WikiAves, 2016)."
25,Procellariidae,Macronectes halli,MGT,petrel-grande-do-norte,Northern Giant-Petrel,,," breeds on South Georgia, Prince Edward, Crozet, Kerguelen, Macquarie, Auckland, Campbell, Antipodes and Chatham Islands and moves broadly through southern seas, usually between latitudes 30�S and 64�S. It is possible that the young circumnavigate before returning to the colony for the first time (Carboneras, 1992c). In Brazil, there are records for the coast in the states of SP and RS; most are from September to December (Carlos et al., 2005b). There are photographic records for the municipalities of Rio Grande and Tavares in RS between August and October (WikiAves, 2016) and museum records from SP in September and October (MZUSP)."
26,Procellariidae,Fulmarus glacialoides,MGT,pardel�o-prateado,Southern Fulmar,,," occurs in the southern seas and breeds in Antarctica and neighboring islands, migrating during austral winter to the southern coasts of Oceania, Africa and South America (Carboneras, 1992c). In Brazil, records are mainly from the southern and southeastern coasts, and can be observed in RS from June to November (Belton, 1984; WikiAves, 2016; MNRJ), in RJ in June (WikiAves, 2016), July and September (MNRJ) and in SP in February, August and September (MZUSP). In BA, one specimen (MZUSP 101816) was collected in Mangue Seco, Janda�ra in July 1994 (Lima, 2006)."
27,Procellariidae,Daption capense,MGT,pomba-do-cabo,Cape Petrel,,," breeds on subantarctic islands, in the Peninsula and in continental Antarctica. It begins moving between February and March and reaches Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico and even northern California. On the Atlantic coast, it reaches Uruguay and Brazil, where it was recorded for northern RJ (Carlos et al., 2004b). Two individuals recovered in Brazil in September (Santos/SP and S�o Francisco do Sul/SC) were banded in the South Orkneys in February (Sick, 1997; Olmos, 2002a). In addition, one specimen was collected in June 1863 in Cabo de S�o Roque/RN (Carlos et al., 2004b) and another four in the municipality of Lauro de Freitas/BA in August 1999 (Lima, 2006). There are also records for SC and RS between June and October (WikiAves, 2016). Museum records indicate presence in RS in July (MNRJ) and in SP in July and August (MZUSP)."
28,Procellariidae,Pterodroma madeira,MGT,,,,," breeds only on Madeira Island, with an estimated population of only 80-85 pairs before the fire in 2010 that devastated its breeding site (Flood & Fisher, 2013). Geolocation studies suggest that the species is highly dispersive on the Atlantic Ocean, but it visits the Brazilian coast regularly during the non-breeding season (Zino et al., 2011)."
29,Procellariidae,Pterodroma deserta,MGT,,,,," moves through the subtropical waters of the Atlantic, returning to the breeding sites on Madeira Island in Portugal in June (Carboneras, 1992c). This species� breeding season extends from early June to mid-November. Its migration starts in November, and wintering areas are usually reached around 10 days later. Geolocation data showed that 17 individuals banded on Bugio Island remained in northern Atlantic waters before laying eggs, incubating and caring for the young. Two wintering areas were identified on the coast of Brazil: one between the states of CE and PE, and another to the south, near the Tropic of Capricorn. Return migration usually starts in the second week of May (Ram�rez et al., 2013)."
30,Procellariidae,Pterodroma mollis,MGT,grazina-delicada,Soft-plumaged Petrel,,," occurs mainly between latitudes 30�S and 60�S on the Atlantic and Indian oceans and, during winter, in the southern seas below the Tropic of Capricorn (Carboneras, 1992c). Three specimens were found at Cassino beach/RS in September and October (Vooren & Fernandes, 1989). There are also records for SE in May (Carboneras, 1992c), SC in June and two more for the coast of RS in November (WikiAves, 2016). Brazilian museum records indicate the species presence in BA in February, August and September and in SP in May (MZUSP; MNRJ)."
31,Procellariidae,Pterodroma incerta,MGT,grazina-de-barriga-branca,Atlantic Petrel,EN,EN," breeds in Tristan da Cunha (Sick, 1997) and moves through the South Atlantic between the South American and African coasts (Carboneras, 1992c). In Brazil, three individuals were collected in RS: one in November 1972 and two in March 1973 (Belton, 1984). Two specimens were collected at Tucuru� Dam in eastern PA in September 1984, 400 km away from the coast (MPEG). This species uses the southern and southeastern coasts of Brazil as a feeding area, but there are also records for the northeastern region (Bugoni, in press). There are photographic records for SC in February and June, and only one record for Mangue Seco/ BA in June (WikiAves, 2016). For RS state the records are from the period between October and April (WikiAves, 2016; MNRJ) and in SP the collected specimens are from January, September and November (MZUSP)."
32,Procellariidae,Pachyptila desolata,MGT,faig�o-rola,Antarctic Prion,,," breeds on the islands of Crozet, Kerguelen, Macquarie, Heard, in Auckland, Arco Scotia, South Georgia, South Sandwich, South Shetland and in Antarctica between October and March, and moves through the southern Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans (where it is rarer). After breeding it migrates north, and there are records for Brazil for PE in July (Carlos et al., 2005a) and for Maraj� Island/PA in August (Martuscelli et al., 1997). In RS, four specimens were found dead at Cassino beach (in June, July, October and November) and another one was collected to the south of Pinhal in September 1990 (Belton, 1994). There are records in June and July for RS (WikiAves, 2016; MNRJ) and for the Arvoredo Marine Biological Reserve in SC (Naka et al., 2002). In July and August in SP (Martuscelli et al., 1997; MZUSP; MPEG), RJ (MNRJ). In BA, this species is largely recorded throughout the coast between May and July (C.G. Machado, pers. obs.) with photographic and museum records, respectively, in June and July (WikiAves, 2016; MNRJ)."
33,Procellariidae,Pachyptila belcheri,MGT,faig�o-de-bico-fino,Slender-billed Prion,,," occurs in the southern Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. Geolocation studies show that the species flies north for as far as 3,000 km after breeding (Carboneras, 1992c). Brazil is used as a wintering area (Martuscelli et al., 1997). There are widespread records on the coast of BA between May and July (C.G. Machado, pers. obs.; WikiAves, 2016; MNRJ). In RJ, specimens have been collected in June-August (MNRJ). In SP, the specimens were collected in June-August and October and December (MZUSP; MPEG; MNRJ). In RS, it is considered common in the Cassino beach region, although time of year is not specified (Belton, 1994)."
34,Procellariidae,Bulweria bulwerii,MGT,alma-negra,Bulwer's Petrel,,," has a pantropical distribution and moves through tropical and subtropical waters across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. The Atlantic populations migrate to deep equatorial waters between Cape Verde and the Brazilian coast after breeding (Carboneras, 1992). Records in Brazil are quite rare, with only one photographic record for Campos dos Goitacazes/RJ in December (Klein, 2011). However, recent geolocation studies determined that parts of the Brazilian territorial sea are regular wintering areas between August and May (Dias et al., 2015)."
35,Procellariidae,Procellaria aequinoctialis,MGT,pardela-preta,White-chinned Petrel,VU,VU," nests on the Malvinas/ Falklands and South Georgia on the Atlantic Ocean. It also breeds on Prince Edward and Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen, Auckland, Campbell and Antipodes (Neves et al., 2006). It moves broadly through the three oceans between latitudes 30�S and 55�S. In Brazil, it is more common southern and southeastern coastal regions (Carboneras, 1992c). Data from geolocators and from satellite transmitters showed that ten individuals captured in South Georgia migrated to areas east of the La Plata River estuary in Argentina and wintered between February and April between Tierra del Fuego and southeastern Brazil until October, when they returned to South Georgia to breed and then lay eggs between November and December (Phillips et al., 2006). In Brazil, there are records for RS in July, August, September, November, December, April and May (Belton, 1984; MNRJ; MZUSP). In April-October at the coast of SP and RJ (Sick, 1997; MNRJ; MZUSP). There are also records for the coast of BA in April and May (WikiAves, 2016), as well as specimens collected in June-August (MZUSP; MNRJ). In PA, the records are from August and September (Sick, 1997; MPEG)."
36,Procellariidae,Procellaria conspicillata,MGT,pardela-de-�culos,Spectacled Petrel,VU,VU," breeds on Inaccessible, Tristan da Cunha and Gough Islands (Olmos et al., 2006). It moves broadly on the Atlantic between latitudes 23�S and 36�S, between the South American coast (from southeastern Brazil to Uruguay) and the African coast (Carboneras, 1992c). In Brazil, it occurs on the southern and southeastern coastal regions (Grantsau, 2010), and there are records for RS in September and November, SC in February, June, July, August and November, and for PR, Esp�rito Santo (ES) and BA in May (WikiAves, 2016)."
37,Procellariidae,Calonectris borealis,MGT,cagarra-grande,Cory's Shearwater,,," individuals were equipped with geolocators at three different breeding sites (the Azores, Canary Islands and Mediterranean). Four out of the eight individuals equipped in the Azores and one out of the seven equipped on Canary Islands wintered in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, associated with the Brazil Current (Gonz�lez-Sol�s et al., 2007). In February 1971, one specimen banded on Savage Islands (between Canary Islands and Madeira) was found dead in Tramanda�/ RS and six other individuals were collected on the same beach (February, March, April, October and December) (Belton, 1984). There are photographic records for almost the entire Brazilian coast from RS to MA between November and June (WikiAves, 2016). Museum specimens were collected in July-August in BA and in January in SP (MZUSP)."
38,Procellariidae,Calonectris edwardsii,MGT,cagarra-de-cabo-verde,Cape Verde Shearwater,NT,," breeds in Cape Verde, from where it migrates between November and February to winter in little-known areas. On the Brazilian coast, there are records for BA � two individuals were collected at Praia do Forte in June of 1995 (Lima et al., 2002), for SP in May, for PR in December (WikiAves, 2016) and for RS in May (Petry et al., 2000). This characterizes the species as a migrant in the Brazilian open sea. It is probably recorded when flying to the productive waters of the southern platform and Subtropical Convergence (Olmos & Bugoni, 2006)."
39,Procellariidae,Puffinus griseus,MGT,pardela-escura,Sooty Shearwater,NT,," is a widespread species that occurs on all seas (Carboneras, 1992c; Grantsau, 2010). It nests in Chile, Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, Malvinas/Falklands and islands around Tierra del Fuego from November to April. It also performs transequatorial migrations outside this period (Cooper et al., 1991; Carboneras, 1992c; Hamilton et al., 1997; Petry et al., 2008). They reach RJ every year and rarely BA during austral winter (Sick, 1983). The records for Brasil are located in: BA in May, June, October and November (Lima, 2006; WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP); RJ in May, June and October (WikiAves, 2016; MNRJ); SP in May to August (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP); SC in May-June (WikiAves, 2016) and RS in different months with a population peak in July (Petry et al., 2008)."
42,Procellariidae,Puffinus gravis,MGT,pardela-de-barrete,Great Shearwater,,," breeds on the Malvinas/Falklands, Tristan da Cunha and Gough (November to April) in southern Atlantic waters (Carboneras, 1992c). Its transequatorial migration begins in April and it returns to the colony in September (Harrison, 1983). This species comes near the Brazilian coast between April and May, when it is flying from the south to the north (Sick, 1997). It is recorded for the northeastern region of Brazil between May and June (Carboneras, 1992c), and for RS in August, October and November, as well as March and May (Petry et al., 2008). Most records are from April to July for the southern and southeastern regions, but there are also records for BA (WikiAves, 2016; MNRJ; MZUSP)."
43,Procellariidae,Puffinus puffinus,MGT,pardela-sombria,Manx Shearwater,,," breeds on the sea of Ireland and stays on the South American coast during boreal winter from December to March (Guilford et al., 2008), especially between Brazil and Argentina, according to data from bands and satellite transmitters (Carboneras, 1992c). This species performs transequatorial and transatlantic migrations. Data from 12 geolocators suggests that migration southwards is through the western African coast, across to the Brazilian coast by the shortest route and then to the south and southwest to winter near the coast of Argentina, south of the La Plata River. The return to the north tends to go through a short westward route through the eastern Caribbean to the east coast of the USA and then through the North Atlantic. All individuals made stops ranging from a couple of days to two weeks in different places and dates (Guilford et al., 2009). Individuals banded in Wales, Ireland and Scotland in July, August and September were recovered in 13 Brazilian states, especially in the southern and southeastern regions of the country, in SC, SP, RS and RJ in September, October, November and December (Mestre et al., 2010). In Brazil, museum records are from September-December in RJ, SP and RS, and in BA there are isolated records in July and November (MZUSP, MNRJ)."
44,Procellariidae,Puffinus lherminieri,MGT,pardela-de-asa-larga,Audubon's Shearwater,,CR," its movements are little known. It occurs in Bermuda, Caribbean, Gal�pagos Islands, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea and, in Brazil, throughout the southeastern and northeastern coasts (Efe & Musso, 2001; Silva-e-Silva & Olmos, 2010). In Brazil, it currently breeds only on Morro da Viuvinha and Morro do Le�o Islands in Fernando de Noronha/PE. The Brazilian population is restricted to 30 fully grown individuals and tends to stabilize, with no signs of influx from individuals from foreign populations (Efe & Serafini, in press). Data from banding and recapture of the young and of adults confirms nest fidelity; the species returns to breed with the same partner every year (Efe, 2004)."
45, Hydrobatidae,,MGT,,,,,
46, Hydrobatidae,Fregetta grallaria,MGT,painho-de-barriga-branca,White-bellied Storm-Petrel,,," occurs in tropical and subtropical seas of the Southern Hemisphere. It breeds on the islands of Lord Howe, Kermadec, Tristan da Cunha, Gough, St. Paul, Amsterdam, Juan Fernandez and Austral (Rapa Island). It apparently migrates to lower latitudes and reaches the Brazilian coast (Carboneras, 1992c; Olmos, 2000a), where it occurs in open sea between RJ and BA in October (Coelho et al., 1990; Sick, 1997)."
47, Hydrobatidae,Fregetta tropica,MGT,painho-de-barriga-preta,Black-bellied Storm-Petrel,,," after breeding on Antarctic and subantarctic islands, migrates north to subtropical and tropical zones, reaching most of the Brazilian coast (Carboneras, 1992c). The subspecies F. t. tropica, which occurs in Brazil, breeds on South Georgia, South Shetland and South Orkney Islands to the east as far as the Antipodes. It uses Brazil as a wintering area (Grantsau, 2010) and there are records for the coast of BA in January (Olmos, 2000b) and for RS (Petry et al., 2016), where it was photographed in November 2011 (WikiAves, 2016)."
48, Hydrobatidae,Oceanites oceanicus,MGT,alma-de-mestre,Wilson's Storm-Petrel,,," breeds on subantarctic islands from Cape Horn east to Kerguelen Islands, and on southern seas on South Shetland and South Sandwich islands and the Antarctic coast (Carboneras et al., 2016). It has been mainly recorded between April and November for several places on the Brazilian coast, from BA to RS (Belton, 1984; MZUSP; MNRJ; WikiAves, 2016). However, there are isolated records for RN in January and for BA in March (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP)."
49, Hydrobatidae,Oceanodroma leucorhoa,MGT,painho-de-cauda-furcada,Leach's Storm-Petrel,,," after breeding in the Northern Hemisphere and in South Africa, its populations migrate mainly southwards as far as the Cape of Good Hope. Part of the population overwinters on the equatorial coast of Brazil (Carboneras, 1992c), and there are records from Amap� (AP) to SP without defined dates (Grantsau, 2010), except for those on the coast of RN that are from January 2015 (WikiAves, 2016) and for some specimens collected in AP in February an May, for PA in January and February, and in CE in January (MZUSP; MPEG)."
50,Pandionidae,,MGT,,,,,
51,Pandionidae,Pandion haliaetus,MGT,�guia-pescadora,Osprey,,," occurs on all continents except Antarctica and is migratory across most of its distribution. It migrates from the Northern Hemisphere to the Amazon Basin and the northern coast of South America between August and November and from Florida to South America through the Caribbean (Poole et al., 2014). The subspecies P. h. carolinensis is a migrant from the north that occurs in Brazil at a higher rate between the end and the beginning of the year, but it can be found there throughout the year (WikiAves, 2016), since immature individuals can remain in the country at least for the first three years of their life (B. Whitney, pers. obs.). Breeding in South America has not been reported, but individuals carrying sticks have been seen, which can be regarded as �learning or practicing� breeding behavior as seen in the Northern Hemisphere (B. Whitney, pers. obs.). Some 28 individuals banded in the USA were recovered in AM; one individual born near New York was collected in Ilh�us/BA (August); two chicks banded in Maryland, USA (July) were recovered in Mato Grosso (MT) (September) and on the Madeira River/AM (October) (Sick, 1997). This species is recorded throughout the year near Manaus, but it is very common from September to March (Stotz et al., 1992). In addition, individuals banded in North and Central America in June and July were recovered in Brazil in 17 different states � AP, RR, AC, Rond�nia (RO), AM, PA, MT, MS, Goi�s (GO), MG, MA, CE, PB, BA, RJ, SP and PR � especially from October to January (Mestre et al., 2010). Specimens have been collected in Brazil from August to May (MZUSP; MNRJ; MPEG)."
52,Accipitridae,,MGT,,,,,
53,Accipitridae,Harpagus diodon,MGT,gavi�o-bombachinha,Rufous-thighed Kite,,," breeds from August to April in the Atlantic Forest and in forest fragments in the Cerrado, and overwinters mainly in the equatorial forests of the Amazon Basin with some individuals staying further north in the Guiana Shield (Cabanne & Seipke, 2005; Lees & Martin, 2014). The species needs to be better studied in the Atlantic Forest in the northeastern region of Brazil to determine if records in austral winter are of a resident population,VAGrant individuals (Lees & Martin, 2014) or overwintering individuals from the south (B. Whitney, pers. obs.). In RS, where it is considered rare, there are records in October, November and May (Belton, 1994)."
54,Accipitridae,Ictinia mississippiensis,MGT,sovi-do-norte,Mississippi Kite,,," occurs in southern central USA from Kansas, Arizona and New Mexico south to Florida (White & Marks, 2016). It breeds in North America and overwinters in South America (Ferguson-Lees & Christie, 2001), especially in Paraguay, southeastern Bolivia, southwestern Brazil and northeastern Argentina (White & Marks, 2016). It breeds in North America between May and July and pre-migration flocks gather in early August in groups of 200-300 birds that move south in early September (Thiollay, 1994). The migration south between September and November seems to be through the foothills of the Andes as far as the Amazonian lowlands (Stotz et al., 1992). From December to February, the species is found in central South America, where the Chaco forest is its main wintering site (Juhant & Areta, 2013). The migration north occurs from late February to April departing from central and northern Argentina, over the Colombian Andes (Juhant & Areta, 2013). In Brazil, this pattern is supported by records from RO, MT, MS, PR and RS (WikiAves, 2016) and by data from AM, PA and MG (Stotz et al., 1992; Vasconcelos et al., 2008a, 2011) that are restricted to the period between September and March. The scarce records of this species for South America during austral winter are of juvenile individuals (Juhant & Areta, 2013) that probably got lost during migration (Bildstein, 2004)."
55,Accipitridae,Buteo platypterus,MGT,gavi�o-de-asa-larga,Broad-winged Hawk,,," breeds from central Canada to southern USA and virtually its entire population (except birds from southern Florida) migrates to South America during boreal winter and reaches northwestern Brazil, with some of the birds covering up to 8,800 km (White et al., 1994) in very large flocks (Bildstein, 2004). In Brazil, it occurs mainly in the Amazon Basin, but there are some records in the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest, with no apparent flocks forming. It can be observed from October to March in the Amazon region and in the Pantanal (in spite of one record for MT in June), and in the southeastern and southern Atlantic Forest � in RJ, MG, PR, SC and RS � from November to January (WikiAves, 2016; MNRJ; MZUSP, MPEG)."
56,Accipitridae,Buteo swainsoni,MGT,gavi�o-papa-gafanhoto,Swainson's Hawk,,," breeds in central and western North America and migrates to South America in boreal winter, especially to northern Argentina, southern Brazil and Paraguay (White et al., 1994). It apparently moves through the inland of the continent heading to the Pampas in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil and it overwinters on the Atlantic coast in southern Brazil (Antas, 1987; Sick, 1997). It is suspected that age separation exists since there is a great concentration of juveniles in Argentina (White et al., 1994) and of immature individuals in Brazil (Sick, 1997) during boreal winter. Studies with satellite transmitters showed that this species gathers on the eastern coast of Mexico and flies from there mainly along the Pacific coast and eastern Andes until it reaches central Argentina, and there are some localized records for instance for RR (Stotz et al., 1992; White et al., 1994). Radio-satellite data showed that the northbound and southbound migration routes use similar paths comprised almost entirely of continental stretches, except in Central America, where some coastal stretches are used (Fuller et al., 1998). One individual banded in Oklahoma (USA) was recovered in AC in February and one chick banded in Alberta (Canada) in August was recovered in November of the same year in RS (Belton, 1984; Sick, 1997). This species can be observed in Tocantins (TO) in March and August (Dornas & Pinheiro, 2011) and in RJ, SP, PR, SC and RS between November and January, and a flock of over 100 individuals has also been reported in AM in November (WikiAves, 2016). Additionally, there is one collected specimen from SC in October (MZUSP 92336)."
57,Charadriidae,,MGT,,,,,
58,Charadriidae,Pluvialis dominica,MGT,batuiru�u,American Golden-Plover,,," exhibits an elliptic pattern of migration. After breeding in the tundra of northern Canada and Alaska, it migrates to Hudson and James Bay in August, from where it crosses the Atlantic � on a nonstop flight when climate conditions are favorable (Wiersma, 1996) � following a costal pathway until it reaches its wintering area in southern South America in early September, namely the Pampas of RS, Paraguay and Argentina, with records of some individuals reaching Tierra del Fuego regularly (Wiersma, 1996; Morrison et al., 2008). During the non-breeding season from September to April, it was recorded in all Brazilian states except MA, PB, SE, BA and ES (WikiAves, 2016). There are population peaks in October and December on the beaches and lagoons in RS (Vooren & Chiaradia, 1990; Dias et al., 2011), large numbers of individuals in November and December in the Para�ba do Sul River Valley in SP (Crozariol, 2011), in the Amazonian region between September and March, presenting peaks in October and November in Manaus/AM and in September and October in RR (Stotz et al., 1992). The species begins its return to the breeding site between January and April through inland South and Central America (Sick, 1983; Wiersma, 1996), quickly reaching northern South America, and going from there to southern USA through the grasslands as far as Canada (Antas, 1987)."
61,Charadriidae,Pluvialis squatarola,MGT,batuiru�u-de-axila-preta,Black-bellied Plover,,," breeds in the Arctic, in the tundra in northern Canada, Alaska and Russia. It leaves its breeding areas heading south between July and September, and juveniles depart 5 to 6 weeks after adults. In general, this species reaches the coast of Guyana and then the Gulf of Maranh�o during fall migration. The return from its wintering areas (coasts of North, Central and South America) occurs between April and mid-May (Wiersma, 1996). Although there are localized records in November for the Marchantaria and Anavilhanas Islands (Stotz et al., 1992), most records are associated with coastal areas throughout the Brazilian coast and are centered in the period between September and May (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG; MNRJ). There are records in all months of the year for RS, but the species is recorded mainly from September to April in this state (Belton, 1994)."
62,Charadriidae,Charadrius semipalmatus,MGT,batu�ra-de-bando,Semipalmated Plover,,," departs from breeding sites in Canada between July and September (adults fly before juveniles) and overwinters on the coast and on all major islands from North, Central and South America. It reaches South America between September and early November and returns from April forward. In boreal spring, Delaware Bay, USA is an important stopover area, where around 70% of the population meets to prey on larvae of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus (Wiersma, 1996). As part of its pathway, it flies across Brazil from S�o Lu�s and the mouth of the Parna�ba River to the Ba�a de Todos os Santos (Antas, 1983), reaching the coast of SP in late August and early September, where it remains during spring and the beginning of summer. The number of individuals begins to decrease in mid-April when adults return to the Northern Hemisphere for breeding and only juveniles remain. It is suggested that the municipality of Ilha Comprida/SP is one of the stopover areas for foraging and resting during the return migration to the Northern Hemisphere (April) and to foraging areas in the Southern Hemisphere (September) (Barbieri et al., 2000). The species appears to be present in Lagoa do Peixe/RS throughout the year, reaching as many as 300 individuals in March (Belton, 1984). There are records for the Amazon Basin in Macap�/AP, Manaus/AM and PA between September and December (Stotz et al., 1992; Campos et al., 2008; Cintra et al., 2011; Silva, 2011b; Valente, 2011). Charadrius modestus breeds in southern South America, on the Malvinas/Falklands, and departs between March and April to its northern wintering areas, which includes Buenos Aires, Argentina and the southern and southeastern regions of Brazil (as far as RJ), and returns between August and September (Belton, 1984; Wiersma, 1996; Azpiroz et al., 2012). It apparently exhibits two migratory routes: one over the Pacific and another over the Atlantic (Blanco et al., 2004). Records confirm the presence of this species between April and August in RJ, SP, PR, SC and RS (Cestari, 2008; Ghizoni-Jr. & Azevedo, 2010; Simpson & Simpson, 2011; WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP)."
63,Charadriidae,Oreopholus ruficollis,MGT,batu�ra-de-papo-ferrug�neo,Tawny-throated Dotterel,,," the subspecies O. r. ruficollis breeds in southern South America, on Chilean coastal islands and in Tierra del Fuego. It migrates in March-April to Ecuador and extreme southern Brazil (Sick, 1997), reaching RS between May and July (Belton, 1984) and possibly reaching SC and RJ, and returning to its breeding sites between August and September (Wiersma et al., 2016). There are records for RJ in May, SC in June and RS from April to August, which confirms this pattern (Maciel & Blanco, 2014; WikiAves, 2016)."
64,Chionidae,,MGT,,,,,
65,Chionidae,Chionis albus,MGT,pomba-ant�rtica,Snowy Sheathbill,,," breeds on the Antarctic Peninsula, on South Shetland, Elephant, South Orkney and South Georgia islands and probably on South Sandwich Islands (Harrison, 1983). Most individuals depart from the breeding site between late April and early July and although its migratory routes are little known, its main wintering areas seem to be the Malvinas/Falklands, Tierra del Fuego and southern Patagonia, with some individuals reaching Uruguay (Burger, 1996). Burger (1996) suggests that this species isVAGrant in Brazil, as Accordi & Hartz (2013) classified it for RS, where it was recorded for the first time in May 1973 (Belton, 1974). However, its occurrence is limited to the period between April and August in the southern states of PR, SC and RS (Dias et al., 2010a), which is also illustrated by photographic records available for RS (WikiAves, 2016)."
66,Scolopacidae,,MGT,,,,,
67,Scolopacidae,Limnodromus griseus,MGT,ma�arico-de-costas-brancas,Short-billed Dowitcher,,CR," females depart before males and juveniles from breeding areas in Alaska, USA and Canada in early July, and the species overwinters in the USA, Central America and the coast of South America (van Gils & Wiersma, 1996). It seems that individuals fly non-stop when migrating south from North America and across the Atlantic to Suriname, where there are population peaks between September and November; when migrating north, its route seems to go through the coast of Guyana and from there across the Atlantic (Rodrigues, 2000). The species seems to use the coast of MA as a stopover area before flying south between September and December to the wintering areas (Carvalho & Rodrigues, 2011). Records confirm this species� presence in Brazil for PA, MA, PI, CE, RN, SE, BA, RJ and RS mainly from October to March (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP, MPEG, MNRJ). There are also records between April and September for AP, PA, MA, PI, CE, RN and BA (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP, MPEG, MNRJ), probably of non-breeding individuals, since several one-year-old shorebirds mostly stay on wintering grounds through first summer (Cristol et al., 1999)."
68,Scolopacidae,Limosa haemastica,MGT,ma�arico-de-bico-virado,Hudsonian Godwit,,," after breeding in the Arctic, a large part of its population gathers along Hudson Bay and James Bay in Canada between late July and mid-August (van Gils & Wiersma, 1996). The species crosses the Atlantic and reaches northern South America, including the Amazon Basin, at the Sustainable Development Reserves of Mamirau� (Melo et al., 2011), Aman� (Santos et al., 2011) and Piaga�u-Purus (Cintra et al., 2011), Anavilhanas National Park (Cintra & Rosas, 2011), Alto Guapor� region (d�Horta, 2011) and the Pantanal (Pocon�/ MT; Cintra, 2011) between September and November. From October to April, the species reaches southern Brazil in SP, PR, SC and RS (Vallejos et al., 2011; Krul et al., 2011; Ferreira et al., 2011; Fedrizzi & Carlos, 2011; Dias, 2011; Barbieri, 2011; MZUSP), in addition to Uruguay and Argentina. Over 1,000 individuals use the Lagoa do Peixe National Park as a stopover site during migration (Belton, 1994; Nascimento, 2011), but their main wintering areas are in extreme southern South America, Tierra del Fuego and southern central Chile. The young appear to depart after the adults, and the return to the north from April onwards is completed with use of little or no (Harrington et al., 1986) stopover sites (van Gils & Wiersma, 1996)."
69,Scolopacidae,Numenius borealis,MGT,ma�arico-esquim�,Eskimo Curlew,CR,," an extinct species that bred in the inland Canadian Arctic and northern central Canada. Millions of individuals gathered on stopover areas throughout the countryside in the USA. In South America, its wintering areas were in the Argentinean Pampas, and it was first recorded in early 19th century in Brazil with specimens collected in Ipanema/SP in September-October and also for AM and MT between September and November (Pelzeln, 1870; Sick, 1997)."
70,Scolopacidae,Numenius hudsonicus,MGT,ma�arico-de-bico-torto,American Whimbrel,,," breeds in Alaska and Canada and migrates to southern USA and South America during boreal winter (van Gils & Wiersma, 1996). During this migration south, which occurs from September to November, it reaches Suriname and then follows to the Gulf of Maranh�o, where there are population peaks between December and February (Rodrigues, 2000). Large gatherings were also recorded on the Reentr�ncias Paraenses Environmental Protection Area (Rodrigues & Carvalho, 2011a), and 10,879 individuals were recorded between Bel�m/PA and S�o Lu�s/MA in January 1982, 1983 and 1986 (Morrison & Ross, 1989). During the migration north from March to May, there is a population peak on Caranguejo Island/MA (Carvalho & Rodrigues, 2011). There are records for Brazil from AP to RS, as well as on Fernando de Noronha/PE (Sick, 1997) throughout the year (WikiAves, 2016), which represents non-breeding individuals, since some one-year-old shorebirds mostly stay on wintering grounds through first summer (Cristol et al., 1999)."
71,Scolopacidae,Bartramia longicauda,MGT,ma�arico-do-campo,Upland Sandpiper,,," breeds in Alaska, southern Canada and northern USA, and overwinters in Suriname, Paraguay, southern Brazil, northern Argentina and Uruguay (van Gils & Wiersma, 1996). After breeding, it migrates between August and September from central North America to grasslands in central and eastern South America through the Amazon Basin (Capllonch, 2011), where it is recorded in small numbers between October and February on Marchantaria Island/AM and in RO (Stotz et al., 1992). It overwinters in the Pampas in southern Brazil (Di Gi�como & Krapovickas, 2005) and the Pantanal (Morrison et al., 2008). Photographic records associated to literature data suggest the species occurs in all of Brazil between September and April (Belton, 1984; Cintra, 2011; Cintra & Rosas, 2011; d�Horta, 2011; Melo et al., 2011; Nunes et al., 2011; Schunck, 2011a, b; Silva, 2011a, b, c; Vallejos et al., 2011; WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG)."
72,Scolopacidae,Actitis macularius,MGT,ma�arico-pintado,Spotted Sandpiper,,," widely distributed in North America, where it nests in open areas close to water bodies and reservoirs. It overwinters in southern USA, Central America and southern South America as far as northern Chile and Argentina (van Gils et al., 2016a). It was recorded in September and November for RR and from July to May for Manaus and Marchantaria Island/AM (Stotz et al., 1992), as well as for RS (Belton, 1984). It visits the Central Plateau from August to October (Negret, 1988). There are recent photographic records for all Brazilian states between September and May. Scarce records between June and August (WikiAves, 2016) are probably of juveniles, since some one-year-old shorebirds mostly stay on wintering grounds through the first summer (Cristol et al., 1999)."
73,Scolopacidae,Tringa solitaria,MGT,ma�arico-solit�rio,Solitary Sandpiper,,," breeds in North America and migrates to Central America during boreal winter (including the Antilles and Bahamas) and to the south as far as southern Argentina (van Gils & Wiersma, 1996). Individuals banded in Canada and the USA in July and August were recovered in the northern and northeastern regions of Brazil (as far as northern BA) in October, November, December and January (Mestre et al., 2010). The species seems to be resident in the northern Amazon Basin in Macap�/AP (Campos et al., 2008). It is common near lakes and rivers in the Amazon Basin and can be seen near Manaus/AM from July to April (Stotz et al., 1992), rarely in flocks (van Gils & Wiersma, 1996). It overwinters in or uses the Pantanal as a stopover ground (Nunes & Tomas, 2008) and it is recorded for RS between September and April (Belton, 1984). It appears in Brazil only from August to May in all states. There are some scarce records during the austral winter (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MNRJ; MPEG), but they are probably of juveniles, since some one-yearold shorebirds mostly stay on wintering grounds through their first summer (Cristol et al., 1999)."
75,Scolopacidae,Tringa melanoleuca,MGT,ma�arico-grande-de-perna-amarela,Greater Yellowlegs,,," breeds from Alaska to eastern Canada and flies through James Bay, British Columbia, Mexico, Central and South America as far as Tierra del Fuego during spring (Piersma et al., 1996). It is a migrant that presents records from August to November for Manaus/AM and Marchantaria Island/AM; it is common during fall, there are small numbers during winter, and only occasional records in spring (Stotz et al., 1992). During the migration south, it occurs in the Pantanal (Morrison et al., 2008) and records suggest that it also flies over the central region of Brazil when returning to the Northern Hemisphere, which reinforces the importance as stopover grounds in the plains and basins of the Tocantins and Araguaia Rivers (Crozariol et al., 2012). The species occurs in all months of the year in Brazil (WikiAves, 2016). Its occurrence during winter months is probably due to immature, non-breeding individuals that remain on wintering areas all year round (van Gills & Wiersma, 1996)."
76,Scolopacidae,Tringa semipalmata,MGT,ma�arico-de-asa-branca,Willet,,," breeds in North America and presents population peaks in both Suriname and the Gulf of Maranh�o during the migration south between September and November, which suggests that the species goes over the coast of French Guiana, from where it crosses the Atlantic Ocean on a non-stop flight (Rodrigues, 2000). It flies over the continent between S�o Lu�s and the mouth of the Parna�ba River to the Todos os Santos Bay, BA (Antas, 1983). It exhibits patterns of seasonal abundance on Caranguejo Island/MA with a population peak during spring migration between March and May (Carvalho & Rodrigues, 2011). Photographic records reveal the occurrence of this species along the Atlantic coast of the entire Brazilian territory throughout the year (WikiAves, 2016). However, scarce records during winter months (from May to July) are probably related to juveniles, since some one-year-old shorebirds mostly stay on wintering grounds through the first summer (Cristol et al., 1999)."
77,Scolopacidae,Tringa flavipes,MGT,ma�arico-de-perna-amarela,Lesser Yellowlegs,,," breeds from May to August from Alaska to southern central Canada as far as James Bay in Canada. It flies through eastern Canada, inland USA and the Atlantic coast, going over Mexico, Antilles and Bahamas to South America, reaching as far as Tierra del Fuego (van Gils et al., 2016b). In Brazil, the species occurs in the entire national territory and there are records for AM from July to February (Stotz et al., 1992), for the Pantanal during the migration south (Morrison et al., 2008) and for RS in all months, especially between September and March (Belton, 1984). Despite being found throughout the year in Brazil (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP, MNRJ, MPEG), records during winter in June and July are probably of juveniles, since some one-year-old shorebirds mostly stay on wintering grounds through the first summer (Cristol et al., 1999)."
78,Scolopacidae,Arenaria interpres,MGT,vira-pedras,Ruddy Turnstone,,," breeds in Alaska and the Canadian Arctic and flies along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts to winter on the coast in the Americas, reaching the peaks in October and December on the beaches and lagoons in RS (Vooren & Chiaradia, 1990; Dias et al., 2011), large numbers of individuals in November and December in the Para�ba do Sul River Valley in SP (Crozariol, 2011), in the Amazonian region between September and March, presenting peaks in October and November in Manaus/AM and in September and October in RR (Stotz et al., 1992). The species begins its return to the breeding site between January and April through inland South and Central America (Sick, 1983; Wiersma, 1996), quickly reaching northern South America, and going from there to southern USA through the grasslands as far as Canada (Antas, 1987)."
80,Scolopacidae,Calidris canutus,MGT,ma�arico-de-papo-vermelho,Red Knot,,CR," breeds in the Canadian Arctic. It gathers in great numbers in Delaware Bay, USA and migrates southwards, reaching the Brazilian coast, as well as Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia, where it stays during the non-breeding season. Some individuals may overwinter in French Guiana or Venezuela (van Gils & Wiersma, 1996; Baker et al., 2005). After leaving the breeding area, the species flies south crossing over or stopping in the mid-Atlantic coast of the USA and on the Antilles, before reaching Brazil. One individual with a geolocator overwintered on the northern coast of Brazil, on the border between MA and PA. Another went south through MA and overwintered around 1,100 km east, and a third one stopped in MA for 12 days and then stopped again at Lagoa dos Patos/RS and went on to overwinter in Argentina. The return flight of this last individual was through the Pantanal (Niles et al., 2010). Population peaks are recorded in the Gulf of Maranh�o: a large number of individuals arrive during fall migration from September to November (Carvalho & Rodrigues, 2011) and during spring migration from March to May, which suggests transoceanic flights from the coast of MA to North America (Rodrigues, 2000). In RS, over 20,000 individuals were seen using the Lagoa do Peixe National Park and the Pinhal region as stopover grounds during their migration north. Banding data suggests that the flight between the southern coast of Brazil and Midwestern USA is a direct one (Harrington et al., 1986) that lasts approximately 13 days � 7,600 km (Sick, 1997). Ilha Comprida/SP is also a stopover site used for resting and feeding during the return migration (Barbieri & Paes, 2008), as well as the mangroves from Mangue Seco/BA, where the species was recorded in mid-April (Lima, 2006). There are recent photographic records for almost all coastal states and they are centered on the period between September and April (WikiAves, 2016)."
81,Scolopacidae,Calidris alba,MGT,ma�arico-branco,Sanderling,,," breeds in the northern Arctic. Its wintering area extends from California to northern Chile on the Pacific and from the north coast of Brazil to Argentina on the Atlantic (Antas, 1987). It is one of the species that flies the longest distance during migration: around 20,000 km from the Arctic to RJ, and then more 5,000 km to Tierra del Fuego (Sick, 1997). During fall migration from September to November, the species reaches the coast of Guyana and then migrates to the Gulf of Maranh�o, from where it leaves to perform transoceanic flights back to North America during spring migration from March to May (Rodrigues, 2000). Most individuals that overwinter (from December to February) in Peru and Chile perform a continental clockwise flight by migrating north along the Pacific coast and returning south along the Atlantic coast. There are three main flyways for its return across North America: (a) through the Pacific coast, (b) through the Gulf of Mexico and Great Lakes region, and (c) through the Atlantic coast (Myers et al., 1985). The species exhibits fidelity to Coroa do Avi�o/ PE, where recovered individuals show the link between migratory sites in PE and Lagoa do Peixe/RS, MA and the USA through field-readable colored bands (Lyra-Neves et al., 2004). There are records from October to December for Marchantaria Island/AM and for the area surrounding the Solim�es River (Stotz et al., 1992). During both migrations north and south, it is present in large quantities in Ilha Comprida/SP, a stopover ground used for resting and feeding (Barbieri & Paes, 2008). Beaches in RS were recognized as the most important wintering areas for this species on the Atlantic coast of South America (Morrison & Ross, 1989). There are records all year round for Lagoa do Peixe/RS, approaching 6,000 individuals in November/December (Belton, 1994). There are recent records for all coastal states, as well as some occasional ones in GO, MG and AM. Most records are from September to April, although the species can be found throughout the year in Brazil (WikiAves, 2016). Some individuals remain in the wintering areas in South America during the breeding season from June to July (Myers et al., 1985; van Gils & Wiersma, 1996),"
83,Scolopacidae,Calidris pusilla,MGT,ma�arico-rasteirinho,Semipalmated Sandpiper,NT,EN," breeds in northern Canada and Alaska, and overwinters mainly in South America (Gratto-Trevor & Dickson, 1994). It flies non-stop for as long as 4,000 km and is known to form flocks of 350,000 individuals. The species presents high fidelity to its breeding sites, but little is known about its wintering areas. Around 2/3 of the juveniles remain in non-breeding areas throughout the year (van Gils & Wiersma, 1996). Long-distance migration between the wintering area in the Southern Hemisphere and the breeding area in high latitudes from the Northern Hemisphere are interspersed with long stopover periods for energy storing, especially in Delaware Bay on the east coast of the USA, where it usually begins to arrive in early May and remains until early June (Mizrahi et al., 2012). In the Amazonian region, there are records throughout the year for PA and AP (Stotz et al., 1992; Campos et al., 2008; WikiAves, 2016) with a population peak in AP in November and December (Campos et al., 2008). There are recent records in all coastal states (WikiAves, 2016). It is recorded all year round in PE, CE and MA and there are population peaks on Caranguejo Island/MA during the fall migration from September to November due to the arrival in northern Brazil of migrants originating from stopover sites in northern South America (Carvalho & Rodrigues, 2011; WikiAves, 2016). The species can be observed in other states in northeastern Brazil (PI, CE, RN, PB, PE, AL, SE and BA) from August to April (Azevedo-J�nior et al., 2001; Cardoso & Nascimento, 2007; Cardoso & Zappelini, 2011; WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG; MNRJ). There are population peaks between November and February in SE (Almeida & Ferrari, 2010) and in March in the Pia�abu�u Environmental Protection Area/AL (Cabral et al., 2006). It is also recorded from August to April for the states in the southeastern and southern regions (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP)."
84,Scolopacidae,Calidris minutilla,MGT,ma�ariquinho,Least Sandpiper,,," breeds from Alaska to Quebec, including Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, and migrates through inland North America, reaching the southern USA, Antilles, Gulf of Mexico and northeastern South America (van Gils & Wiersma, 1996). Migration between the wintering area in the Southern Hemisphere and the breeding area is interspersed with long stopover periods for energy storing, especially in Delaware Bay on the eastern coast of the USA, where they start arriving in mid-April and depart from around the third week of May (Mizrahi et al., 2012). There are records from August to April in the Amazonian region for AM, RR, AP and PA (Stotz et al., 1992; Campos et al., 2008; Cintra & Rosas, 2011; Cintra et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011; Silva, 2011a, b; Valente, 2011; WikiAves, 2016), as well as for MA, PI, CE, RN, PB, PE, AL, SE and BA on the northeastern coast (Sick, 1997; Albano & Gir�o, 2011; Azevedo-J�nior & Larraz�bal, 2011a; Cardoso & Zappelini, 2011; Gir�o & Albano, 2011a; Irusta & Sagot-Martin, 2011; Santos, 2011; Serrano, 2011; WikiAves, 2016) and for the coast of RJ, SP, SC and RS (Crozariol, 2011; Santos & Alves, 2011; WikiAves, 2016). It was recorded in September for MT (Cintra, 2011; d�Horta, 2011) and in May for AP (MPEG)."
85,Scolopacidae,Calidris fuscicollis,MGT,ma�arico-de-sobre-branco,White-rumped Sandpiper,,," breeds in the Canadian Arctic and migrates to wintering areas in Patagonia. It flies from northeastern North America over the Atlantic Ocean to northern South America and reaches the Guianas in late August, where they remain until mid-September. It moves gradually through the northern coast of South America to areas southeast of the mouth of the Amazon River, when it enters the continent and flies for approximately one month until it reaches Paraguay and RS between mid and late October (Harrington et al., 1991). Some individuals remain during the entire summer in this locality and there are peaks of nearly 7,000 individuals in November and December in Lagoa do Peixe/RS (Belton, 1994), but the main non-breeding area for this species is in southern Argentina and Chile, where it arrives in mid-September, October and November. During its migration to the most meridional regions of South America, it can fly over the Amazon Basin and other humid areas in the country � using the Pantanal as a stopover area (Nunes & Tomas, 2008) � before it reaches Lagoa do Peixe/RS and Tierra del Fuego in Argentina (Barbieri & Paes, 2008). Spring migration starts in late March and early April and seems to be done in long flights. Eventually, it uses Ilha Comprida/ SP as a stopover ground for resting and feeding (Barbieri & Paes, 2008) on its way to North America, where it likely stops to obtain enough fat reserves to accomplish a direct flight to the Canadian Arctic between late May and mid-June, and then breed (Harrington et al., 1991). There are records centered in the period between August and May for almost all states in Brazil that are scarce in June and July and restricted to BA, SC and RS (WikiAves, 2016), probably represented by young non-breeding individuals, since some one-year-old shorebirds mostly stay on wintering grounds through their first summer (Cristol et al., 1999). There is also one museum record for SP in June (MZUSP 2094)."
86,Scolopacidae,Calidris bairdii,MGT,ma�arico-de-bico-fino,Baird's Sandpiper,,," breeds in northern North America, departs in mid-August from its breeding grounds to winter in South America, and returns in late June (Steeves & Holohan, 1995). Its migration occurs especially through the inland, through grasslands in North America, the Rocky Mountains and Andes. Females depart first and are followed by the young (van Gils & Wiersma, 1996). Two individuals banded in the USA and Canada were recovered in the estuary of the Amazon River in January and April (Sick, 1997) and there are also other records for this locality in September (Melo et al., 2011; Santos et al., 2011). There is evidence that this species uses the Pantanal as a stopover site (Nunes & Tomas, 2008). Photographic records are restricted to RS, where it is recorded between September and April (Belton, 1984; Dias, 2011; WikiAves, 2016). There is just one museum record for SP in May (MZUSP 102373)."
87,Scolopacidae,Calidris melanotos,MGT,ma�arico-de-colete,Pectoral Sandpiper,,," breeds on the northern coast of North America, from western and northern Alaska to northern central Canada, to Hudson Bay, as well as in northwestern Siberia. It migrates south during winter and reaches from southern Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina to southern South America and southeastern Australia and New Zealand (van Gils & Wiersma, 1996). Its migration seems to be elliptic because it moves south over the western Atlantic Ocean and returns through central regions of North America. Its wintering area includes the entire Pantanal (Nunes & Tomas, 2008) and the area south of it, which makes this the second most numerous Nearctic shorebird species in a census taken in these plains (Morrison et al., 2008). There are photographic records for almost all of Brazil, but records for the northeastern region are quite scarce and restricted to September, October and February. Records in the Amazonian region are restricted to the period between August and December and those in the southeastern and southern regions are distributed from September to April (WikiAves, 2016). Museum records are distributed irregularly across several states but restricted to the period between August and November (MZUSP; MNRJ, MPEG)."
88,Scolopacidae,Calidris himantopus,MGT,ma�arico-pernilongo,Stilt Sandpiper,,," breeds in northern Alaska east to Victoria Island and west and south to Hudson Bay in Canada. It migrates to South America (northern Chile, Bolivia, Brazil, northern Argentina and Uruguay) in winter and small populations winter in southern USA (van Gils & Wiersma, 1996). Its flyway seems to go from Venezuela straight to the Upper Amazon and Central Brazil, reaching the Atlantic coast in RS (Sick, 1997). Females start migrating from the second week of July on, males start a week after, and juveniles only in mid-August. The return flight is over the coast of Colombia and Venezuela. It reaches the USA in April and the breeding areas in Canada in late May. Males arrive two days before females. Some individuals remain in the wintering areas all year round, but they usually migrate in groups as large as hundreds of individuals (van Gils et al., 2016c). In Brazil, records are centered in the period between September and April and show the presence of this species in Amazonian regions � AM, PA and RO (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG) � in southeastern and southern Brazil � RJ, SP, PR, SC and RS �, in the Pantanal � MT and MS �, and in CE, RN and PE in northeastern Brazil (WikiAves, 2016)."
90,Scolopacidae,Calidris subruficollis,MGT,ma�arico-acanelado,Buff-breasted Sandpiper,NT,VU," breeds in the central and western Arctic and migrates from late July to mid-September to wintering areas in the Southern Hemisphere, which are located mainly in the Pampas in Argentina and Uruguay. In general, it flies non-stop through inland North America and coastal Canadian provinces, crosses the Gulf of Mexico and flies as far as northern South America. It moves inside the continent and has wintering areas in southeastern Bolivia, Paraguay, southern Brazil and northern Argentina (Piersma et al., 1996). The migration south is probably non-stop and adults depart before juveniles. Some individuals fly over Hudson Bay in Canada and the region of the Great Lakes, and then cross the Atlantic heading south (van Gils et al., 2016d). Its main wintering area is on the coast of the La Plata River in the eastern Pampas in Argentina, adjacent to the large lagoon complexes in Uruguay and RS in Brazil. The migration north starts between February and March and is through the central region of South America, across the Gulf of Mexico and central USA and Canada, before reaching the coast of the Arctic in April-May (Lanctot et al., 2010). In Brazil, there are records between September and April for AC, RO, PA northern Pantanal (MT), and for RJ, SP, PR, SC and RS in (WikiAves, 2016; MPEG; MZUSP)."
91,Scolopacidae,Phalaropus tricolor,MGT,pisa-n'�gua,Wilson's Phalarope,,," breeds in southern Canada and northern USA from May to June and overwinters from northern Peru to Uruguay, reaching as far as Tierra del Fuego. After breeding, adults migrate to the hypersaline Great Lakes in western North America attracted by food abundance for molting and weight gain. Females migrate in mid-June before males, which migrate before juveniles. The species crosses the Pacific and reaches the western coast of South America as far as the Andes. Its main wintering areas are in Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. It returns through high elevations in South America in mid-March, Central America and the Gulf of Mexico. It reaches its breeding areas in late April/early May. It migrates usually at night and in large groups (van Gils & Wiersma, 1996). This species is present in Brazil between August and May in GO, MT, MS, MG, RJ, SP, PR, SC and RS, and there is a unique record for MS in July (WikiAves, 2016)."
92,Stercorariidae,,MGT,,,,,
93,Stercorariidae,Stercorarius skua,MGT,mandri�o-grande,Great Skua,,," breeds in northern and eastern Europe and overwinters on the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, Cape Verde, Caribbean and northern Brazil and one small group overwinters in Grand Banks/Newfoundland, Canada. This species departs from its breeding areas in August-September, heading south. It overwinters mainly in open sea and its return migration is between March and April. Immature individuals eventually remain in the south during the breeding season (Furness, 2016). In RS, there are records of ill or dead individuals in the open sea or occasionally along beaches in April, July and August (Belton, 1994). There are reports of individuals banded in Europe without confirmed dates that were recovered in MA in February and in CE and PI in March (Sick, 1997). Museum records are restricted to PA in December and January (MPEG) and to SP in August (MZUSP)."
94,Stercorariidae,Stercorarius chilensis,MGT,mandri�o-chileno,Chilean Skua,,," its movement is little known, but it seems to fly north after breeding on islands and remote coastal areas in Chile and Argentina, reaching southern Peru and possibly to the east as far as west of the Malvinas/Falklands (Furness, 1996). It is considered a winter visitor in Brazil (Furness, 1996) and there are few records published for the country (Olmos et al., 2006), for SC in July, September and November (Piacentini et al., 2005) and many others without accurate locality for BA, ES, RJ, SP and RS (Olmos et al., 2006; Grantsau, 2010). The abundance of records in WikiAves, which are centered in the period between June and September, suggests a regular presence of this species in the country, especially in RS and SC; there are also records for PR, SP and ES (WikiAves, 2016)."
95,Stercorariidae,Stercorarius maccormicki,MGT,mandri�o-do-sul,South Polar Skua,,," nests in Antarctica, leaves the colonies in March and returns in October-November (Furness, 1996). In general, it flies towards the North Atlantic through the African coast. Adults seem to remain near the colonies, but there are records of some juveniles performing long migrations (Olmos et al., 2006). This species occurs in Brazil mainly during the non-breeding season and there are photographic records for MA in December, RN in October, SE in September and May, and for BA from September to November, as well as from April to June (WikiAves, 2016). There are also records for SP in May (MZUSP 102643), August and November, PR in May, SC in July, August and November, and for RS in April (WikiAves, 2016)."
96,Stercorariidae,Stercorarius antarcticus,MGT,mandri�o-ant�rtico,Brown Skua,,," occurs below the Tropic of Capricorn on southern seas and reaches Tierra del Fuego, the Antarctic Peninsula and New Zealand. The subspecies S. a. antarcticus is more frequent in Brazil; it breeds on the Malvinas/Falklands and in southeastern Argentina and overwinters in the open sea in southeastern South America (Furness, 1996). Individuals from the subspecies S. a. lonnbergi, which breed on the islands of the Austral Ocean, in the Antarctic Peninsula and islands south of New Zealand, were recovered in RS, SC, PE, AL and CE (Sick, 1997; Olmos, 2002a). Most populations probably remain near their breeding areas, but especially those located more to the south are considered migratory (Olmos et al., 2006). Photographic records for Brazil are centered in the winter and they document the species� presence in BA in May, PR in June and September, SC in August and RS between June and October (WikiAves, 2016) and occasionally on the coast of MA (Hurtado et al., 2012)."
97,Stercorariidae,Stercorarius pomarinus,MGT,mandri�o-pomarino,Pomarine Jaeger,,," nests in the tundra between Greenland, Canada, Alaska, Siberia, northern Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia (Olmos et al., 2006). After breeding, it begins long transequatorial migrations mainly in September to overwinter in low latitude seas especially in the Northern Hemisphere. It returns in May, usually in smaller flocks (Furness, 1996). In Brazil, there are records for PA, SP and RS (Olmos, 2000c) and photographic records for the coast between SE and RS, as well as for PA, MA, PI and RN, which are centered in the period from September to May (WikiAves, 2016)."
98,Stercorariidae,Stercorarius parasiticus,MGT,mandri�o-paras�tico,Parasitic Jaeger,,," breeds in the Arctic, in the coastal tundra region, primarily between 57�N and 80�N. It overwinters on oceans in the Southern Hemisphere, especially near the coast of South America, southern Africa, southern Australia and New Zealand. It is mostly a transequatorial migrant and few individuals overwinter in the Northern Hemisphere. It departs from the colony in August flying south along the coast. The return journey is quick and happens between April and May (Furness, 1996). On the Brazilian coast, particularly in RJ, it occurs in larger numbers in January, but there are records from March to May and from September to December. One individual banded as a chick in Finland was recovered in RJ in June and another banded in Scotland was recovered in AL in May (Sick, 1997). The species occurs regularly on the coast of SC, and although most records and most individuals are from November to April (Piacentini et al., 2005), there are occasional records throughout the year, which also happens in RS (Belton, 1994; WikiAves, 2016). For all other states (PA, MA, PI, CE, RB, BA, ES, RJ, SP and PR), records are restricted to the period between September and May (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP)."
99,Stercorariidae,Stercorarius longicaudus,MGT,mandri�o-de-cauda-comprida,Long-tailed Jaeger,,," nests on the central region of Scandinavia, Siberia, Alaska and Greenland, and there are occasional records for Scotland and Spitsbergen (Olmos et al., 2006). This species is a highly pelagic transequatorial migrant that moves south between August and October and returns to the Northern Hemisphere between April and May (Furness, 1996). Its flyways and wintering grounds are little known (Furness et al., 2016), but there are records for Brazil for SE, BA, SP, SC and RS between October and April (Belton, 1994; WikiAves, 2016)."
101,Laridae,,MGT,,,,,
102,Laridae,Leucophaeus atricilla,MGT,gaivota-alegre,Laughing Gull,,," breeds in northern USA and southern Canada and migrates to South America. It overwinters from Mexico to southern Peru on the Pacific coast and from North Carolina to Brazil on the Atlantic coast (Burger et al., 2016). In Brazil, it occurs from the mouth of the Amazon River to the bay of S�o Marcos/ MA (Antas, 1987) Although its typical distribution on the Brazilian coast is in AP, PA and MA, there are also records for AM, CE, RJ, SP (Lima et al., 2010) and Trindade Island (Dias et al., 2010a). In the Amazonian region, records are for AP from August to April and for PA from September to July (Valente, 2011; Xavier & Boss, 2011; WikiAves, 2016; MPEG). In the Northeast region, it occurs in MA in almost every month of the year (Rodrigues & Carvalho, 2011b; WikiAves, 2016) and in CE, PI, RN and BA from September to May (Albano & Gir�o, 2011; Gir�o & Albano, 2011a, b; WikiAves, 2016), but there are also records of what probably are juveniles for CE and RN in July (WikiAves, 2016). For RJ and SP, there are few records in January, April and November (WikiAves, 2016) and for RS, the species was recorded in January and July (Sick, 1997; WikiAves, 2016)."
103,Laridae,Larus atlanticus,MGT,gaivota-de-rabo-preto,Olrog's Gull,NT,," occurs from southeastern Uruguay to Argentina, where it breeds (Grantsau, 2010). An estimated number of 150 individuals overwinter annually in RS and they occupy sparsely the oceanic coast and the estuary from Lagoa dos Patos, where at most 50 individuals occur regularly between April and August (FZBRS, 2013). Although records are centered in the period between April and August, there are occasional records from September to November, February and March (WikiAves, 2016). The species also occurs in SC (Burger et al., 2016) in June and August (WikiAves, 2016) and PR in April and June (Pacheco et al., 2009; WikiAves, 2016)."
104,Sternidae,,MGT,,,,,
105,Sternidae,Onychoprion fuscatus,MGT,trinta-r�is-das-rocas,Sooty Tern,,," occurs on tropical and subtropical seas and is widely distributed on all oceans. As soon as chicks fly, all birds depart from the colony; adults return after 2-3 months at sea and use the colony as a roost before beginning a new breeding cycle (Gochfeld et al., 2016a). The subspecies O. f. fuscatus is the only one that occurs in Brazil and it breeds in the USA, in islands in the Gulf of Guinea and in the South Atlantic (Gochfeld & Burger, 1996). In Brazil, it breeds between September and March in Fernando de Noronha/PE, Trindade/ES, Atol das Rocas/RN, Abrolhos/BA, Ilha Guarita/BA and Martin Vaz/ES (Sick, 1997; Alves et al., 2004; Fonseca-Neto, 2004). Specimens were collected at BA in March and July (Lima, 2006; MZUSP) and at ES in January, April and December (MZUSP)."
106,Sternidae,Chlidonias niger,MGT,trinta-r�is-negro,Black Tern,,," breeds in continental regions in Europe, Asia and North America, and it migrates through the coast of both the Pacific and Atlantic to overwinter on the coast of Africa and of Central and South America (Burger & Gochfeld, 1996). In Brazil, there are records of one individual recovered in Macau/RN in September 1986 that had been banded in Berlin (Germany), one individual in nuptial plumage in RS in June (Belton, 1994), and records for CE in October (Albano & Gir�o, 2011). Several records for CE, MA and RS centered in the period between September and February (WikiAves, 2016) suggest that Brazil is an important wintering destination for this species."
107,Sternidae,Sterna hirundo,MGT,trinta-r�is-boreal,Common Tern,,," breeds in North America, Eurasia and the southern Caribbean from April to August. It migrates from late August to October to Santa Cruz Province in Argentina through the Atlantic Ocean, and to Peru through the Pacific Ocean. It returns in mid-March and April (Cordeiro et al., 1996; Gochfeld et al., 2016b). The population that overwinters in Brazil originates from breeding colonies on the east coast of the USA and Canada, as well as from the Great Lakes in North America. Adults reach the northern coast of Brazil around late September and fly over the Caribbean and Guianas before the young. There are population peaks between October and November, and it is in November that this species flies south through the inland northeastern region of Brazil, as far as RS, along the Atlantic coast (Hays et al., 1997), as found through statistical analyses (Mestre, 2007). Breeding adults return in March/April (Hays et al., 1997), but immature individuals or those that cannot breed may remain (Antas, 1987). Individuals banded on the Portuguese islands of Azores and in southern Spain between April and July were recovered mainly on the coast of BA, but also in CE and PE, between December and May (Lima et al., 2005; Mestre et al., 2010). The largest gatherings of individuals of this species in Brazil are in BA and RS (within which Lagoa do Peixe is an important site for resting, molting and weight gain) (Nascimento & Santos, 2010), with peaks of up to 14,000 individuals recorded in January and February (Belton, 1994). Individuals banded in Argentina and in southern Brazil were recovered on the coast of BA, which suggests that there are stopover grounds on the coast of Brazil used during the migration north (Lima et al., 2005). Although there are records from the entire Brazilian coast throughout the year, they are centered in the period of September to April (Wikiaves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG; MNRJ)."
108,Sternidae,Sterna dougallii,MGT,trinta-r�is-r�seo,Roseate Tern,,VU," breeds in areas in the Northern Hemisphere � North and Central America, Azores, Great Britain, Sri Lanka and islands in the North Pacific � and migrates south during winter. It is resident on oceanic islands and small regions in the northern coast of South America, Africa, Arabia, Asia and Oceania (Gochfeld & Burger, 1996). The population that overwinters in Brazil originates mainly from breeding colonies on the east coast of the USA and Canada, as well as on the Great Lakes in North America (Antas, 1987). Individuals banded in North and Central America in June and July were recovered in Brazil in 11 states from the coast of AP to northern ES, especially between December and February (Mestre et al., 2010). Tavares et al. (2013) suggest that this species is a regular migrant in northern RJ. It also seems to use a transatlantic flyway, as shown by an individual banded in Mangue Seco/BA that was recovered in a breeding colony in Azores and another one banded in England recovered in Mangue Seco (Lima et al., 2001a). Museum records are restricted to BA in August, February and March (MZUSP)."
109,Sternidae,Sterna paradisaea,MGT,trinta-r�is-�rtico,Arctic Tern,,," breeds from May to July in septentrional zones of the Holarctic and flies along the Brazilian coast when migrating to Antarctica to overwinter. When migrating south, the North American population follows the Gulf Stream as far as Europe and then flies south along the African coast, crossing once again the Atlantic at the level of the current of Guinea (Antas, 1987). Recent geolocation studies showed that this species is able to travel more than 80,000 km in one year. Eleven individuals were attached with geolocators in Greenland, seven of which used flyways that were parallel to the African coast and four that went along the east coast of Brazil (Gochfeld et al., 2016c). All birds remained in the Atlantic sector of the Antarctic Ocean at latitude 58�S from December to March (Gochfeld et al., 2016c). Individuals banded in the USA were recovered in Brazil in BA in July and August, RJ in March, SC in November and RS in December (Belton, 1994; Sick, 1997; Lima et al., 2004c; Gir�o et al., 2008). Photographic records suggest the scarce presence of the species on the entire Brazilian coast from Maraj� Island/PA to RS, especially from September to April (WikiAves, 2016)."
110,Cuculidae,,MGT,,,,,
111,Cuculidae,Micrococcyx cinereus,MGT,papa-lagarta-cinzento,Ash-colored Cuckoo,,," occurs in Bolivia, Uruguay, northern Argentina and Brazil and is migratory at the extreme south of its distribution (Payne, 1997), with records for the Brazilian Amazon associated with migrants that originated in the south (Sick, 1997). It seems that this species breeds in southern and southwestern Brazil and migrates north during winter (Payne & Bonan, 2013). Records of breeding activity for RS in November, combined with a lack of records for the south during colder months from May to July in SC and RS (Belton, 1994; WikiAves, 2016), seem to confirm the migratory pattern. In other states � AC, RO, PA, TO, MT, MS, GO, CE, RN, PB, AL, SE, BA and SP � records are scarcely distributed throughout the year (Lyra-Neves et al., 2012; WikiAves, 2016; MPEG; MZUSP)."
112,Cuculidae,Coccyzus melacoryphus,MGT,papa-lagarta,Dark-billed Cuckoo,,," occurs from northern South America to Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and all of Brazil (Sick, 1997). There is a lack of data about its migratory pattern, but it seems to be a migrant, especially in the extreme south of its entire distribution (Payne, 1997). In southern and southeastern Brazil � MG, ES, RJ, SP, PR, SC and RS � photographic and museum records are centered in the period of October and April (MZUSP; MNRJ; MPEG; WikiAves, 2016. However, in northern, northeastern and central-western Brazil, although there are records sparsely all over the year, it seems to be concentrated between January and September (MZUSP; MNRJ; MPEG; WikiAves, 2016. Breeds in BA and RS (Maur�cio et al., 2013; WikiAves, 2016."
113,Cuculidae,Coccyzus americanus,MGT,papa-lagarta-de-asa-vermelha,Yellow-billed Cuckoo,,," breeds in North and Central America and flies at night during fall to the Antilles and Bahamas (2,000-3,000 km) from where it moves south in non-stop flights of over 4,000 km to wintering grounds in South America. Its migration occurs during the night mainly across the ocean, though it also flies over the continent. This species overwinters east of the Andes, from Colombia and Venezuela to Brazil (MT), Uruguay and Argentina (Payne, 1997), and reaches Brazil during boreal winter (Sick, 1997). Geolocation data showed that one individual flew around 9,500 km during its migration south through Central America to overwinter in Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. Its spring flyway went over the Caribbean, which was different from its fall flyway. In addition, it also flew round-trip between New Mexico and Mexico at the end of the summer during both years it was monitored before it was captured at the breeding site (Sechrist et al., 2012). In Brazil, except for SP where it seems to be recorded all year round (Crozariol, 2011), its occurrence is limited to November until May in almost all states (Belton, 1984; Fedrizzi & Carlos, 2011; Melo et al., 2011; Nunes et al., 2011; Vallejos et al., 2011; Vasconcelos et al., 2011; Xavier & Boss, 2011; WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP), which corroborates the presented migratory pattern."
114,Caprimulgidae,,MGT,,,,,
115,Caprimulgidae,Chordeiles minor,MGT,bacurau-norte-americano,Common Nighthawk,,," breeds in North and Central America and overwinters in South America as far as central Argentina (Sick, 1983; Cleere, 2016). It has many subspecies and one of them, C. m. chapmani, overwinters in central Brazil and northern Argentina (GROMS, 2008). All Brazilian records, including photographic, vocal and collected specimens are restricted to September to April (Albano & Gir�o, 2011; Costa et al., 2011; d�Horta, 2011; WikiAves, 2016, MZUSP, MPEG, MNRJ). However it is important to emphasize that photographic record must be carefully analysed due to the difficulty in distinguishing this species from C. acutipennis."
116,Apodidae,,MGT,,,,,
117,Apodidae,Cypseloides niger,MGT,,,,," breeds in North America and migrates south, sometimes in large flocks, and groups of 300 to 400 individuals have already been recorded in California (Chantler, 1999). Geolocation data showed that the fall migration of C. n. borealis started between September 10th and 19th, that it reached the wintering grounds in Western Amazonia (especially in AM) between September 28th and October 12th, and that it departed from these grounds heading to the breeding sites between May and June (Beason et al., 2012). This is the first piece of evidence of wintering grounds for this species in Brazil, which is why it is considered migratory."
118,Apodidae,Chaetura meridionalis,MGT,andorinh�o-do-temporal,Sick's Swift,,," breeds in Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina, and migrates to Panama, northern Colombia, Venezuela, Suriname and French Guiana during winter. It reaches its breeding site in early September, where it remains until mid-April (Chantler, 1999; del Hoyo et al., 2016b). It breeds in SP in September-March and departs from Atlantic Forest lowlands in southeastern SP in April-August (Aleixo & Galetti, 1997). It also can be seen in RJ, breeding between late August and early September; it departs in March/April. It nests in MT in October and November (Sick, 1997) and it is considered a migrant in RS (Accordi & Hartz, 2013), where there are records of breeding activity from November to January (Belton, 1984). Photographic records suggest breeding activity in CE, BA, MG, RJ, SP, PR, SC and RS between October and January (WikiAves, 2016). Occurrence records are centered in the period of September to April (WikiAves, 2016; MNRJ; MZUSP; MPEG)."
121,Falconidae,,MGT,,,,,
122,Falconidae,Falco peregrinus,MGT,falc�o-peregrino,Peregrine Falcon,,," occurs in all regions of the world and is migratory in only part of its distribution. In Brazil, it occurs as a migrant (White et al., 1994) originating from breeding areas in the Northern Hemisphere. Individuals banded in the USA, Canada and on the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon on the Canadian coast mainly between April and October were recovered in 16 Brazilian states between November and March, especially SP, PR and RS (Mestre et al., 2010). This species can be seen along the Amazon River and its main tributaries during the boreal winter from October to May (Stotz et al., 1992; Costa et al., 2011; Melo et al., 2011) and in PA in October, November (Silva, 2011c; MPEG) and March (Silva, 2011b). It was recorded in northern Cant�o State Park/TO in April, when it was probably returning to the Nearctic region for the start of the next breeding season, using the Araguaia River channel as flyway (Pinheiro & Dornas, 2009; Dornas & Pinheiro, 2011). There are also records in November for the region of Banco dos Cajuais/CE-RN (Gir�o & Albano, 2011a), for CE from October to May, for RN and SE from November to March (Sousa, 2011; WikiAves, 2016), in BA from December and January (MZUSP) and for RJ, SP, PR, SC and RS from October to April (Belton, 1984; WikiAves, 2016; MNRJ; MZUSP)."
123,Psittacidae,,MGT,,,,,
124,Psittacidae,Amazona pretrei,MGT,papagaio-char�o,Red-spectacled Parrot,VU,VU," endemic to Brazil and occurs in SC and RS. Breeding grounds are known for this species only in RS (Belton, 1984; Prestes et al., 1997). After leaving the breeding areas in several regions of RS, the entire population performs a longitudinal and altitudinal migration from January, searching for a larger supply of Araucaria angustifolia seeds, to northeastern RS and from there to southeastern SC (Martinez & Prestes, 2002) when juveniles are already part of the flock. The return to its breeding areas occurs between June and August, depending on the availability and duration of the pine season in the highlands of SC (Prestes & Martinez, 2008). Photographic records (WikiAves, 2016) and field data (N.P. Prestes & J. Martinez, pers. obs.) show the presence of this species in SC from January to June and in RS almost in every month, but with few records in April and May."
125,Furnariidae,,MGT,,,,,
126,Furnariidae,Cinclodes fuscus,MGT,pedreiro-dos-andes,Buff-winged Cinclodes,,," is regarded as resident in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina, but the population that breeds in central and southern Chile and Argentina migrates to southern Brazil, southeastern Paraguay, Uruguay and northern Argentina during winter (Remsen Jr., 2003). In Brazil, the northern-most record of the species is for Lagoa do Peri in Florian�polis, SC in May and other records are restricted to RS (Naka et al., 2000) between April and September (WikiAves, 2016; MNRJ; MZUSP)."
127,Tityridae,,MGT,,,,,
128,Tityridae,Phytotoma rutila,MGT,corta-ramos,White-tipped Plantcutter,,," occurs in Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil, where it is recorded only in RS and occurs occasionally as a winter visitor in the extreme western region of the state (Belton, 1985), especially in the region of the Espinilho State Park (FZBRS, 2013). Photographic records indicate that this species occurs in RS only between April and August (WikiAves, 2016)."
129,Tyrannidae,,MGT,,,,,
130,Tyrannidae,Inezia inornata,MGT,alegrinho-do-chaco,Plain Tyrannulet,,," breeds in Argentina, Paraguay and eastern Bolivia, and has been recorded in Peru, Brazil and northern Bolivia during austral winter (Fitzpatrick, 2004), when it settles in tropical lowlands that are hot and humid (Joseph, 1996). Available data about breeding activities are restricted to the presence of birds with enlarged gonads in November in Bolivia (Fitzpatrick, 2016). It occurs in MT and MS from May to September (MZUSP). There is also a localized banding record for southeastern PA in September (SNA, 2016), and records for RO in July (Capllonch et al., 2009) and August and in AC from May to August (MPEG). Further studies are necessary to fully comprehend this species� migratory pattern."
131,Tyrannidae,Elaenia chilensis,MGT,guaracava-de-crista-branca,Chilean Elaenia,,," breeds mainly in southern Argentina and Chile in Patagonia (Capllonch et al., 2011), but it can also be further north in Chile, for instance in the Fray Jorge Reserve (Pyle et al., 2015). It migrates north during austral winter, at least in part through the Brazilian coast, but it also seems to fly along the east slope of the Andes (Marini & Cavalcanti, 1990), reaching northeastern and northern Brazil (Amazon Basin included), Peru, and possibly Colombia, respectively (Hosner, 2016). In Bolivia there are records during the breeding season, but they are probably related to late migrants (Hosner, 2016). The migration southwards seems to follow a diffuse route from the Amazon to Central Brazil (Marini & Cavalcanti, 1990). West-central Argentina (e.g., Mendoza and San Juan Provinces) also seems to be part of a spring migration route to Patagonia (Cueto et al., 2016), and this species reaches its breeding sites in Patagonia in mid-October (Brown et al., 2007). Geolocation data (Jim�nez et al., 2016) suggested that three individuals banded on Navarino Island in Tierra del Fuego migrated north at the end of February along the eastern coast of South America, stopped for around 10 days on the eastern coast of Brazil, before flying west to wintering grounds in east-central Amazonia, where they arrived between late April and early June. They departed from this site between late September and late October and arrived back at the breeding site between late November and early December (Jim�nez et al., 2016). In Brazil, vocal records and collected specimens corroborate this pattern to the Amazon region (WikiAves, 2016; MPEG). In northeastern Brazil, records include data from the literature and are from February to July (WikiAves, 2016; Ruiz-Esparza et al., 2011; MPEG). In southeastern and southern Brazil, records are centered in February and May (Pacheco & Gonzaga, 1994; WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP)."
132,Tyrannidae,Pseudocolopteryx acutipennis,MGT,tricolino-oliv�ceo,Subtropical Doradito,,," occurs in central and eastern Andes from Colombia to northwestern Argentina and in lowlands in western Paraguay, in addition to occasional records for southeastern Peru, northeastern and eastern Bolivia and extreme southwestern Brazil (MT and MS) (Grantsau, 2010; Bostwick, 2016). It breeds from December to April in the Bolivian highlands and populations from Bolivia, as well as those from Argentina, migrate along the Andes towards the Amazonian lowlands and the Paraguayan Chaco. It is recorded for the lowlands of Bolivia and Peru only as an austral winter visitor (Bostwick, 2016). In Brazil, there are records for the coast of PR without precision of date, for a fluvial island in RO in June-July and for the Pantanal in MT and MS in May and September (Vasconcelos et al., 2008a). Although there is a lack of museum data, photographic records corroborate a migration during austral winter with records for the central-western region (MT, MS and GO) from May to September. There are two records for RS in December (WikiAves, 2016)."
133,Tyrannidae,Pseudocolopteryx flaviventris,MGT,amarelinho-do-junco,Warbling Doradito,,," breeds in central Chile, northern and eastern Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil from September to March and, during the non-breeding season, it migrates to extreme northern Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil, reaching SP and Paraguay (Botswick, 2004a). In Brazil, records corroborate this migratory pattern by showing occurrences between April and September for RS, SC, PR and SP (Ridgely & Tudor, 1994; Scherer-Neto et al., 2011; WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP 10947 [SP, 1922, June]). However, there is no recent evidence of breeding activity in Brazilian territory."
134,Tyrannidae,Serpophaga griseicapilla,MGT,alegrinho-trinador,Straneck's Tyrannulet,,," breeds in northwestern Argentina and perhaps southern Bolivia. During its non-breeding season, it migrates to Paraguay, Uruguay and southern Brazil (Cueto et al., 2008; Fjelds�, 2013). A winter visitor in extreme southern Brazil (Straneck, 1993), first documented in the country in RS in May of 2001 (Bencke et al., 2002). Photographic records verify its presence in SC in September, and in RS centered in the period between May and September (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP 86172 [RS, 2009, August]), corroborating such a migratory pattern."
135,Tyrannidae,Attila phoenicurus,MGT,capit�o-castanho,Rufous-tailed Attila,,," occurs in Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela and Brazil. It breeds in southern and southeastern Brazil (from RS to southern RJ) and probably in northeastern Argentina and eastern Paraguay (Walther, 2016). Migrants are recorded from Paraguay, eastern Bolivia, and central Brazil to southern Venezuela during austral winter (Walther, 2016). In the Brazilian Amazon, it is recorded only during austral winter from May to October (Ridgely & Tudor, 1994; MZUSP; MPEG), as corroborated by photographic records, museum specimens and banding data, while records for the southeastern and southern regions are centered in the period between October and April (Belton, 1985; SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG)."
136,Tyrannidae,Tyrannus tyrannus,MGT,suiriri-valente,Eastern Kingbird,,," breeds in North America and stays during boreal winter in South America as far as Argentina, especially in the Amazon, and there are some records for the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest (Sick, 1997; Mobley, 2004f). It reaches the southwestern Amazon in late September, clearly associated to fruit availability (Antas, 1987). It is seen arriving in great flocks in the Peruvian Amazon in mid-October (Fitzpatrick, 1980). Its migration to the southern Amazon is fast, after which it migrates north heading to Central America (also following fruit availability), where it arrives in January/February, and migrates back to the North America (Antas, 1987). According to geolocation data, the species departs from its breeding area in the Great Plains of North America in August or early September, migrates through the Caribbean Sea or through the Gulf of Mexico to the Amazon Basin (Bolivia and Brazil) � which is a distance of 6,400 km from its breeding area � and arrives there in October, where they remain for around 100 � 11 days. After this period, it flies to a second wintering area in northwestern South America (Colombia, Ecuador and Peru), where it remains for 75 � 12 days before returning to its breeding site in April (Jahn et al., 2013a). There are records for AM and AC between October and March (Almeida, 2011a, b; Guilherme & Aleixo, 2011; WikiAves, 2016; MPEG), for AC, AM, MT, MS and RJ between November and February, and for RR in October and PR in November (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG). Museum records for PA are widely distributed from April to December (MPEG) and need to be better understood."
137,Tyrannidae,Empidonax alnorum,MGT,papa-moscas-de-alder,Alder Flycatcher,,," breeds from western Alaska to British Columbia, Canada and the USA and overwinters in western South America in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, northern and eastern Bolivia, northern Argentina and western Brazil (Farnsworth & Lebbin, 2004a). In Brazilian territory there are records for PA in February, AM in December and April, the Pantanal in MS in November (Vasconcelos et al., 2008; MPEG) and AC from October to March (WikiAves, 2016; MPEG)."
139,Tyrannidae,Contopus cooperi,MGT,piu�-boreal,Olive-sided Flycatcher,NT,," occurs from Alaska, across Canada, the USA and Mexico to the Amazonian region in Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil including its southeastern region (Farnsworth & Lebbin, 2004b). It is a nocturnal migrant that flies great distances through the forests in western North and Central America and overwinters (boreal) in South and Central America. It departs from its breeding site in North America between August and September, reaches South America in October-November, and departs again in March-April (Altman & Sallabanks, 2000; Farnsworth & Lebbin, 2004f ). In Brazil, there are records of a population from October to April for western Amazonia (in RR, AC, AM, PA and MT), and of another for the Atlantic Forest south of the S�o Francisco River in BA, ES, RJ, SP and PR (WikiAves, 2016)."
140,Tyrannidae,Contopus virens,MGT,piu�,Eastern Wood-Pewee,,," breeds in Canada and the USA in August and September, overwinters in Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia and western Brazil, occasionally remaining further north (Costa Rica), and returns in April (Farnsworth & Lebbin, 2004c). It remains during winter in Brazil (Sick, 1997) and there are photographic records for AC, AM, RO, MT and GO between October and May (WikiAves, 2016), which corroborates available literature records for AM from November to April (Almeida, 2011a, b; Costa et al., 2011) and museum data from November to March for AC, AM, RO (MPEG)."
141,Tyrannidae,Lessonia rufa,MGT,colegial,Austral Negrito,,," breeds in central Chile and Argentina and migrates north, dispersing along the coast and then into the lowlands of the continent. It overwinters in northern Chile, southern and eastern Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil (Farnsworth & Lebbin, 2004d), and there are records for SP (Silva-e-Silva & Olmos, 2007), PR (Bornschein et al., 1997), SC (Azevedo & Ghizoni-Jr., 2005) and RS (Belton, 1985; Bencke, 2001). According to photographic records, it is present in RS from January to September, in SC in February and in SP in September (WikiAves, 2016). Museum records are restricted in July (MZUSP)."
142,Tyrannidae,Xolmis coronatus,MGT,noivinha-coroada,Black-crowned Monjita,,," breeds in central Argentina and migrates north to central Bolivia, western Paraguay, Uruguay and extreme southern Brazil (western RS) (Farnsworth & Langham, 2004a; Cueto et al., 2008). Some breeding populations migrate to winter in tropical latitudes, while others overwinter in south temperate latitudes (Jahn et al., 2004). It seems to be present in RS from May to August (Belton, 1985), which is confirmed by photographic records for this state between April and September, and there is also a record of a possibleVAGrant for SP in May (WikiAves, 2016). There is only one museum record in RS in July (MZUSP 8829)."
143,Vireonidae,,MGT,,,,,
144,Vireonidae,Vireo olivaceus,MGT,juruviara-boreal,Red-eyed Vireo,,," breeds in North America, from where it flies to join Vireo chivi in Brazil during boreal winter (Sick, 1983). Geolocation data suggests that ten individuals from one breeding population that had been captured in northwestern Pennsylvania, USA, wintered in northwestern South America. Most of them used only one wintering site, but two individuals used one wintering site from late October to early December before reaching their final wintering site, where they remained for four months. During spring migration, individuals migrated through Central America through the Yucat�n Peninsula and crossed the Gulf of Mexico, landing near the delta of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. Fall flyways could not be properly mapped. The dates in which individuals reached the wintering area varied from October 14th to November 4th, and the departure dates from South America in spring in late March were correlated with the arrival dates to the wintering site (Callo et al., 2013). The lack of specimens in the Brazilian Amazon when compared to eastern Peru suggests that most of the population overwinters in the foothills of the Andes and only a small number does so to the east in the Amazon (Stotz et al., 1992). However, this species is present in the Amazonian region in Brazil from September to March (Almeida, 2011a, b; Stotz et al., 1992), as suggested by photographic and museum records for RR, AM, RO, PA and MT between August and April (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG). Also, there are two specimens collected in AM in July (MZUSP)."
145,Vireonidae,Vireo altiloquus,MGT,juruviara-barbuda,Black-whiskered Vireo,,," breeds in Florida, Bahamas, Cuba and Cayman Islands and migrates to the Amazon Basin (Sick, 1997; Brewer & Orenstein, 2010). Records in Brazil are mainly to the north of the Basin and are from September to February (Stotz et al., 1992). Only small numbers occur south of the Amazon River, and the southermost record is for Sinop/MT in March (WikiAves, 2016). Photographic records and collected specimens for AM and PA are from September to March (WikiAves, 2016; MPEG), which confirms the pattern suggested in the literature."
146,Hirundinidae,,MGT,,,,,
147,Hirundinidae,Pygochelidon melanoleuca,MGT,andorinha-de-coleira,Black-collared Swallow,,," occurs in extreme eastern Colombia, southern and eastern Venezuela, Guianas, Amazon and southern Brazil, and there are occasional records for southeastern BA, upper Paran� River, southern GO and for the border between Brazil and Argentina in Iguazu Falls (Turner, 2016a). It associates with rivers that have falls and rapids (Sick, 1997). In RO, forms large flocks, breeds from June to October, uses emerged stony grounds on river channels and vanishes when rainfall starts in mid-November (M. Somenzari, pers. obs.). Records for the Amazonian region in RR, AP, AM, PA, RO, MT and TO are centered in the period between April and November, but there are also records for GO and for MG in almost all months of the year (WikiAves, 2016)."
148,Hirundinidae,Progne subis,MGT,andorinha-azul,Purple Martin,,," breeds in Canada and the USA and overwinters in South America, mainly in Bolivia and Brazil (Turner, 2004). It migrates south across Central America, gathers in great numbers in the Manaus region/AM, and then flies especially to SP and MT (Antas, 1987; Sick, 1997). Recorded once in large flocks in interior SP but last seen in 1993 (Willis & Oniki, 1982). Geolocation data showed breeding in northern Pennsylvania, and that migration south started in late August in a non-stop flight to the Yucat�n Peninsula, where individuals remained for 3 to 4 weeks before flying to overwinter in the Amazonian region (October to April). Another tracked individual flew even more during winter and reached the Pantanal region (according to a description in Antas et al., 1987. They departed from the wintering site in the first two weeks of April (Stutchbury et al., 2009). Individuals banded in the USA and Canada in June and July were mostly recovered in the Brazilian Amazon, especially in AM between October and April (Mestre et al., 2010). Large gatherings of the species were recorded for TO, reaching as many as 40,000 individuals (Olmos & Pacheco, 2008), especially in the regions of the Cant�o State Park and in the city of Caseara between November and December in consecutive years (Pinheiro & Dornas, 2009), as well as in RO in October and from February to April, according to photographic records (WikiAves, 2016). In most Brazilian states (except for SC and RS), it can be observed between August and May (WikiAves, 2016) and in BA it arrives in mid-October and departs in March (P.C. Lima, pers. obs.)."
149,Hirundinidae,Progne elegans,MGT,andorinha-do-sul,Southern Martin,,," breeds from October to February-March in southern Bolivia and Argentina. After the breeding season, it forms great flocks and migrates to western Amazonia, including southeastern Colombia, northeastern Peru, and western Brazil, where it spends all winter from April to October, and it can even reach as far as eastern Panama. There are also incidental records for the USA (southern Florida) and the Malvinas/Falklands (Turner, 2016c). In Brazil, it has been photographed in AM between June and October, in AC in March and June, in AP in July and in RO in October (WikiAves, 2016). There is just one collected specimen from AM in April (MPEG 54096 [AM, 1997, April])."
150,Hirundinidae,Tachycineta leucopyga,MGT,andorinha-chilena,Chilean Swallow,,," breeds from central Chile and southwestern Argentina to Tierra del Fuego and migrates north during austral winter to central Bolivia, Paraguay and southern Brazil, which presents records for RS (Belton, 1985; Turner, 2004), SC, PR, SP and RJ, that are centered in the period between April and October (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP 98240 [SP, 1968, July)."
151,Hirundinidae,Riparia riparia,MGT,andorinha-do-barranco,Bank Swallow,,," breeds in high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and migrates to lower latitudes and to the Southern Hemisphere in boreal winter. The subspecies R. r. riparia breeds in North America (from central and western Alaska to southern central and northeastern Mexico), in Eurasia, and locally in northwestern Africa. During boreal winter, it flies to South America and Africa (Turner, 2004). The species occurs in almost all of Brazil (Sick, 1997) and records are centered in the period between September and April (Belton, 1985; Sick, 1997; Nunes & Tomas, 2008; Cintra, 2011; Costa et al., 2011; Dias, 2011; Dias et al., 2011; Ferreira et al., 2011; Melo et al., 2011; Vasconcelos et al., 2011; Accordi & Hartz, 2013; Silva et al., 2013; WikiAves, 2016). Collected"
152,Hirundinidae,Hirundo rustica,MGT,andorinha-de-bando,Barn Swallow,,," breeds in medium and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and migrates during boreal winter to lower latitudes and to the Southern Hemisphere (Turner, 2004). The subspecies H. r. erythro? gaster flies from North America to Tierra del Fuego and occurs in large flocks in virtually all of Brazil from September to March (Belton, 1985; Sick, 1997). Although it breeds mainly in the Northern Hemisphere, part of its population has settled in eastern Argentina since the early 1980�s (Azpiroz et al., 2012). The number of pairs has since risen and today there are two different breeding populations: one in North America and another more recent one in South America. Genetic testing of the South American population suggested that there is still a significant genetic flow with the North American population (Billerman et al., 2011). The South American population is supposed to molt during austral winter (June, July and August) in northeastern South America (specifically in northern Brazil, French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana and Venezuela), which are areas that become available as soon as swallows from North America migrate to their breeding areas in the Northern Hemisphere (Garcia-Perez et al., 2013). A recent geolocator study from nine birds has confirmed that the South American population migration goes no further than northern South America in austral winter (Winkler et al., 2017). Recent data corroborates that the species occurs in almost all of Brazil but are centered in the period between September and April (WikiAves, 2016; MPEG). The records of AM are distributed thoughout the year (WikiAves, 2016), probably due to population overlap. It is important to mention that the differentiation within the populations is complicated owing to the occurrence of migratory individuals from both populations."
153,Turdidae,,MGT,,,,,
154,Turdidae,Catharus fuscescens,MGT,sabi�-norte-americano,Veery,,," breeds in the USA and Canada and migrates in late August and early September to South America, where it overwinters between September and April. Literature and geolocation data suggest that many individuals depart from southeastern USA in the fall and fly over 1,500 km across the Caribbean Sea to northern South America, where they restore their energy reserves in coastal stopover grounds. Between the Caribbean coast and wintering grounds located 3,000 km to the south, there are many areas with suitable habitat in the Amazon Basin. They probably stop for multiple days during this route and can do so as many as two times (Bayly et al., 2012). This species� wintering grounds include the Amazon, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest from the Southeast region of Brazil (Collar, 2005; Heckscher et al., 2011), but the south-central and southeastern regions of Brazil (Cerrado areas) were identified as its main wintering areas (Remsen Jr., 2001). Photographic and museum records confirm its presence in Brazil between October and April (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG). The return north from the wintering grounds is probably through the eastern Amazon Basin (Stotz et al., 1992). The highly seasonal occurrence pattern in RO (September to November) and afterwards in Manaus/AM (February to April) suggests that the species moves regularly in the Amazon. Recent geolocation data suggests that the species settles in non-breeding areas in South America � most of them west of the Central Brazil Shield � and then migrates to a second region in lowland Amazonia and on the Guiana Shield before returning north, probably induced by flood cycles in the southern Amazon Basin. Thus, this species has two wintering sites in the Amazon, perhaps following the local increase on food abundance associated with river levels in the Amazon Basin (Heckscher et al., 2011)."
157,Turdidae,Catharus minimus,MGT,sabi�-de-cara-cinza,Gray-cheeked Thrush,,," departs from breeding areas (Siberia, Alaska and Canada) in mid-August and reaches northern South America in September-October, where it overwinters. The return migration starts in April-May and this species reaches its breeding areas in late May/early June. Its migration flights cover an average of 300 km and individuals rest for one or more nights in between flights (Collar & Christie, 2013). It is a rare migrant in Manaus/ AM with a similar number of records during the period between October and December and March-April, but it seems that it does not winter in the Manaus region, and its wintering grounds are practically unknown (Stotz et al., 1992). Museum records are from AC in November, AM in February and March (MPEG) and PA in November and December (Silva, 2011b; Valente, 2011; MPEG)."
158,Turdidae,Catharus swainsoni,MGT,sabi�-de-�culos,Swainson's Thrush,,," breeds in North America and overwinters southwards as far as Argentina and northwestern Brazil (Collar, 2005) between November and March, where there are records for AM in November, February and March (Sick, 1997), MT in December (MZUSP 89116), and for AC in the period of October to March (WikiAves, 2016; MPEG). There are also records for the southeastern and southern regions of Brazil, namely for RJ in November (Scott & Brooke, 1985), SP in February (MZUSP 64231), SC in January and June, and RS in January, as well as records without dates for RO (Olmos et al., 2011)."
159,Turdidae,Turdus flavipes,MGT,sabi�-una,Yellow-legged Thrush,,," occurs in Colombia, Venezuela, Trinidad, Tobago, Guyana, Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil (Collar et al., 2016). It migrates altitudinally occupying higher regions during spring and summer and foothills during winter (Antas, 1987; Joseph, 1996; Alves, 2007). Populations from the mountains of RJ and ES fly to lower elevations in the austral winter, enlarging their coastal populations (Sick, 1997). In Intervales State Park in southeastern SP, there are records for a lowland region of the Atlantic Forest (70-350 m) only during winter between May and August (Aleixo & Galetti, 1997), but in northeastern SP there is a record of a nesting event at 60 m asl in October (Oliveira Jr. et al., 2014). At Ilha da Queimada Grande, it is one of the most abundant species during austral winter (Marques et al., 2012), as well as at Ilha do Cardoso, where it is stated as a partial migrant recorded mainly between April and October (Castro et al., 2012). Photographic records suggest this species� presence throughout the year in ES, RJ, SP, PR and SC, but it is restricted to the period between September and April in RS (WikiAves, 2016), where it breeds (Belton, 1985; Maur�cio et al., 2013). In BA, it also seems to be present all year round, though there are no records in March, May and June. Records of breeding activity are centered in the period between September and January, and they are from elevations both higher and lower than 600 m in WikiAves (at 2 and 741 m in SP and at 10 and 906 m in PR). SNA data suggests that this species is present in SP all year round, both at an elevation of 3 and 750 m (SNA, 2016), which does not fully either support or refute the hypothesis of altitudinal migration. However, it is widely accepted that the species migrates altitudinally in the Serra do Mar, therefore a project aiming specifically to elucidate its migratory pattern is being conducted (A.C. Guaraldo, pers. obs.)."
160,Mimidae,,MGT,,,,,
161,Mimidae,Mimus triurus,MGT,calhandra-de-tr�s-rabos,White-banded Mockingbird,,," breeds in Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, and occurs in southern and southwestern Brazil in the non-breeding season (Cody, 2005). Photographic records confirm its occurrence in Brazil between March and November in MT, MS, RJ, SP, PR, SC and RS, without any evidence of breeding activity (Pinto, 1944; Belton, 1985; Bornschein et al., 1997; Bencke, 2001; Lima & Aulicino, 2008; Maciel & Gaertner, 2014; WikiAves, 2016)."
162,Parulidae,,MGT,,,,,
163,Parulidae,Setophaga ruticilla,MGT,mariquita-de-rabo-vermelho,American Redstart,,," breeds in Alaska, Canada and eastern USA and migrates to Central America, Caribbean and northwestern South America, as well as to southern USA in small numbers (Curson, 2016a). In Brazil, it occurs only in the Amazon: in RR with records between September and April (Stotz et al., 1992; Sick, 1997; WikiAves, 2016), and in AM with records in January (WikiAves, 2016), April and November (Stotz et al., 1992) and October (MPEG 43351). This species departs from breeding areas in North America between July and September and reaches South America in October, returning from late March on and arriving at the breeding site in April-May (Curson, 2016a). It seems to exhibit higher fidelity to wintering areas in the Neotropics than to breeding areas in the North Temperate Zone, probably because individuals remain in the wintering area during their first year of life (Holmes & Sherry, 1992). Populations from the west of the wintering area originate from the northwest of the breeding areas and populations from the east of the wintering area originate from the east and south of the breeding areas. In general, this species reduces its migration distance by flying mainly along a north-south axis between its breeding and wintering sites (Norris et al., 2006)."
164,Parulidae,Setophaga petechia,MGT,mariquita-amarela,Yellow Warbler,,," occurs from Canada and the USA to northern South America in Colombia, Venezuela and northwestern Brazil. Individuals overwinter from western and southern Mexico to the south through Central America and in northern South America from southern to northern Bolivia and in the Brazilian Amazon (Curson, 2010). In Brazil, records are restricted to the period of September to May in the Amazon region in the states of RR, AP, AM, PA (Stotz et al., 1992; WikiAves, 2016; MPEG)."
166,Parulidae,Setophaga striata,MGT,mariquita-de-perna-clara,Blackpoll Warbler,,," originates from North America overwinters regularly in Amazonian lowlands, and its main wintering site in South America is in the Orinoco and Upper Amazon (Sick, 1997). This species arrives in Brazil between September and October (Sick, 1997) and visits forest edges and conserved forests in Manaus/ AM. In Brazilian amazon records are centered in the period between November and April (Stotz et al., 1992). In southeastern Brazil, it occurs only occasionally (Curson, 2010), with records for RJ from January to May (Sick, 1997). Photographic and museum records confirm the pattern found in the literature: the species is present in RR, AP, AM and PA between October and May, in BA in January, in Distrito Federal (DF) in April, in MG in May, in RJ in February and March, and in SP in March (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP 103227 [SP; 1969, March]; MPEG), which defines it as a boreal winter migrant."
167,Icteridae,,MGT,,,,,
168,Icteridae,Dolichonyx oryzivorus,MGT,triste-pia,Bobolink,,," breeds in North America from May to July and flies non-stop in August through the sea of the Antilles and the coast of Venezuela. In Florida these birds converge into large flocks until they reach their wintering areas in eastern Bolivia, southern central Brazil, Paraguay and northern Argentina, covering 20,000 km in this round trip. Its main wintering site is the Pampas from southeastern South America (Di Gi�como & Krapovickas, 2005; Azpiroz et al., 2012). This species reaches the Pantanal in MT in Brazil in November, and then northeastern Bolivia, Paraguay and the Pampas in Argentina, after crossing the entire Amazonian region (Sick, 1983, 1997; Fraga & Christie, 2016). Three individuals were recorded for Cachoeira de Nazar�/RO in November while flying across the Amazon (Stotz et al., 1992). Geolocation data from 15 individuals captured in three different breeding areas in the USA suggested that fall migration occurs through the Caribbean with a stopover in northern Venezuela, and another in Bolivia in November. 12 individuals flew to a region in Argentina between December and March, where they molted completely before the spring return migration (Renfrew et al., 2013). Records for RS were made in December (Belton, 1985) and sound records for MT in November, while photographic records for MS were between November and March. For SP there is only one record in January (WikiAves, 2016). Museum records are restricted to AM in April (MPEG)."
169,Thraupidae,,MGT,,,,,
170,Thraupidae,Sporophila beltoni,MGT,patativa-tropeira,Tropeiro Seedeater,,VU," endemic to Brazil. Occurs in the Cerrado from BA (bordering GO) to RS (Repenning & Fontana, 2013). Sexually active individuals start to arrive at the breeding site (from northeastern PR to northeastern RS) in mid-October and depart in late January, disappearing completely in the first week of March. There is evidence suggesting that individuals of this population arrive with others from the same genus in southern MG and surrounding states, which are possibly wintering sites. The center of the state of SP seems to be a passing or resting area during migration (Repenning & Fontana, 2013). Photographic records confirm this pattern and present the first record of this species for BA (WikiAves, 2016)."
171,Thraupidae,Sporophila palustris,MGT,caboclinho-de-papo-branco,Marsh Seedeater,EN,VU," breeds in northeastern Argentina, extreme southern Brazil, Uruguay and possibly southeastern Paraguay during austral spring and summer. It migrates to the Central-West and Southeast regions of Brazil and eastern Paraguay (Jaramillo, 2011c; Rising, 2011). It has been recorded in flocks with other species from the same genus from the Amazon and Central Brazil (Sick, 1997), and has been observed in flocks of more than 1,000 individuals foraging in pastures in the Araguaia River basin in southeastern PA in mid-September 2009, 2010 and 2013 (Cavarzere et al., 2015). Photographic records are scarce and distributed between PA, MT, TO, MS, GO, MG, SP and RS, as well as DF, between September and April (WikiAves, 2016). The northern limit of its wintering site is in Bico do Papagaio/northern TO (Dornas et al., 2013) and the breeding population from Brazil is restricted to RS. It is definitely a migratory species, but details of its movements are not fully known."
172,Thraupidae,Sporophila hypochroma,MGT,caboclinho-de-sobre-ferrugem,Rufous-rumped Seedeater,NT,," occurs in northeastern and eastern Bolivia, in the North, Central-West and South regions of Brazil, central Paraguay and northeastern Argentina (Rising, 2011). Its wintering area reaches the central eastern portion of Bolivia and northern and central Brazil (Ridgely & Tudor, 2009). In Brazil, recent records for RS are distributed between October and February, and for MT and MS between June and November (WikiAves, 2016). For GO, it was recorded for the Emas National Park in October (Sick, 1997). For the North region of the country, it was recorded for tributaries of the Mamor� River in RO in June (Whittaker, 2004), and for TO, in the municipalities of Filad�lfia (inside the boundaries of the Fossil Trees Natural Monument) and Duer� (Dornas et al., 2013) in July and October respectively."
173,Thraupidae,Sporophila cinnamomea,MGT,caboclinho-de-chap�u-cinzento,Chestnut Seedeater,VU,," breeds during spring and austral summer in the Pampas in southeastern South America (Azpiroz et al., 2012), which includes RS (Maur�cio et al., 2013), and flies north right after that period (Jaramillo, 2011d). It has been recorded for Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay in August and from October/November to May. Monospecific gatherings of tens of individuals were observed in late February before the migration. This species is rare in PR, especially during spring and summer, and it is likely that only localized records occur during its migration, as well as in MT and central SP, where it flies through Dourados and Itirapina heading south during spring. In the region of the Tri�ngulo Mineiro, this species has been observed in mid-September with other seedeaters that also migrate south, such as S. palustris, S. melanogaster, S. hypoxantha and S. pileata (Kr�gel et al., 2013). Photographic records confirm the distribution pattern from the literature, in which the species is recorded in Brazil from September to May, namely in TO, GO, MT, MS, MG, SP, PR, SC, RS, and evidence of breeding activity exists for MS and RS in January and February (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP 88533 [SC, 2009, December])."
176,Thraupidae,Sporophila melanogaster,MGT,caboclinho-de-barriga-preta,Black-bellied Seedeater,NT,VU," endemic to Brazil, and occurs from the Central-West east to the Southeast and South regions (Jaramillo & de Juana, 2016). All breeding population is confined to the campos de altitude in SC and RS (Rovedder et al., 2013). It reaches its breeding site between October and November, and between February and March (Rising, 2011) it flies north searching for hotter, more humid regions (Azpiroz et al., 2012). The Jaguaria�va region/PR seems to be used as a stopover ground during migration (Carrano & Ribas, 2000). Photographic records suggest that this species� presence is restricted to the period between September and March in TO, GO, MG, SP, PR, RS and SC (WikiAves, 2016). There are also collected specimens from SC in December (MZUSP). Its occurrence during winter remains unknown and needs to be studied further."
177,Cardinalidae,,MGT,,,,,
178,,Piranga rubra,MGT,sanha�o-vermelho,Summer Tanager,,," breeds in the USA and Mexico and overwinters in a large area from Central America to the western Amazon. In South America this species seems to be more abundant along lower slopes of the Andes (Hilty, 2011). It is an uncommon winter visitor in Manaus/ AM and there are records for RR and PA in December (Stotz et al., 1992; Silva, 2011c). Museum and photographic records confirm its presence in RR, AP, AM and PA between October and March (WikiAves, 2016; MPEG), but there are occasional records for AM in May and July (WikiAves, 2016)."
179,,Pheucticus aureoventris,MGT,rei-do-bosque,Black-backed Grosbeak,,," occurs mainly in the Andes from Venezuela to Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and southwestern Brazil (Sick, 1997). Breeding records are restricted to Colombia from November to January and to Argentina in December (Brewer & de Juana, 2017). It is only recorded in MT, MS and RO in Brazil during winter from May to September (WikiAves, 2016), as well as in AM and GO in July and August (Serpa et al., 2014; MPEG 73473 [AM, 2011, August])."
181,Anatidae,Dendrocygna bicolor ,MPR:  ,marreca-caneleira,Fulvous Whistling-Duck,,," occurs from California to Argentina, in all of Brazil and also in Africa and India. It is, however, rare or it appears only occasionally in many places (Sick, 1997). There are populations residing in CE, MG, SP, PR, SC and RS, as suggested by occurrence records (WikiAves, 2016) distributed throughout the year, as well as in the Araguaia River region (L.F. Silveira, pers. obs.). In RS, part of the population remains in the state all year round, but another part migrates (Belton, 1984) following the same pattern as Netta peposaca: it flies to the lower Paran� River region in Argentina, which is its main breeding area according to banding and recapture records (Antas, 1994; Nascimento et al., 2003). Its movement inside the Brazilian territory is not fully understood, but it was suggested that it moves because of local droughts and floods (Antas, 1994; Sick, 1997). There are records of breeding activity for SP (between September and March), SC (December), and RS in May (WikiAves, 2016) and in October and December (Belton, 1984). In BA, this species is present on lagoons and wetlands during winter (P.C. Lima, pers. obs.)."
181,Anatidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
182,Anatidae,Coscoroba coscoroba ,MPR:  ,capororoca,Coscoroba Swan,,," occurs in South America from central Chile, Pantanal, and southern Brazil south to Tierra del Fuego. In Brazil, it can be found in PR, SC, RS (Grantsau, 2010) and Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) (Conservation International, 2009). It breeds in RS (Belton, 1984; Nascimento et al., 2001; Maur�cio et al., 2013), where the Taim wetlands and Ecological Station are the most important breeding sites in Brazil. Part of its population departs from the Station between December and February and returns between late June and September, but most return in August and remain for at least 60 days, during which they molt. Built nests are seen in late June and chicks begin to appear in the first week of August, though most of them appear only in September. The exit route from Brazil to Argentina is the natural corridor composed of rivers, lakes and wetlands in the central plains of RS from the flood plains of the Ibicu�, Butu�, Santa Maria, Vacaca� and Jacu� Rivers (Calabuig et al., 2010). Individuals that reach southern Brazil seem to fly up to 1,700 km in a straight line and the only route is through extreme western RS, which is evidence of the connection between southern Brazil and northeastern Argentina (Calabuig et al., 2010). However, available photographic records on WikiAves confirm its year-round presence in RS, which corroborates the fact that its migration to Argentina is only partial (Calabuig et al., 2010). Data on WikiAves also suggests the presence of this species during almost the entire year in SC (except for February and June), in PR (except January, March, May and November) and in MS between June and October, which is the northern limit of its distribution. This way, geolocation studies should be performed to investigate how regular this movement to the south (to Uruguay and Argentina) made by the population that breed in Brazil is."
183,Anatidae,Neochen jubata ,MPR:  ,pato-corredor,Orinoco Goose,NT,," occurs from Venezuela to Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil, both in the Amazon and in Central Brazil (Sick, 1997). It is considered sedentary in most of its distribution, but there are records of small movements. It exhibits migratory behavior in the Amazon: there is a large breeding population in the Juru� River between June and October, after which disperses widely in the Amazon Basin (Carboneras, 1992a; Endo et al., 2014). Photographic and sound records available on WikiAves corroborate literature data and show that this species is present in the Amazon Basin only during the dry season (July to October), with records of breeding activity in November and December for Roraima (RR) (WikiAves, 2016). In Mato Grosso (MT) it is present between March and August (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP), and in Goi�s (GO) and Tocantins (TO) it is resident and there are records of breeding activity between April and September (WikiAves, 2016)."
184,Anatidae,Callonetta leucophrys ,MPR:  ,marreca-de-coleira,Ringed Teal,,," occurs from northern Argentina to Bolivia, Paraguay, and Brazil in MT, RS, SP, Distrito Federal (DF) and MG (Sick, 1997). Literature data suggests that it is a migratory species that originates from extreme southern South America (Chesser, 1994; Sick, 1997; Nunes & Tomas, 2004). The direction and amplitude of its movements are not well defined, but there certainly is dispersal after breeding, which expands its distribution near to the coast and in lower latitudes (Carboneras, 1992a). However, photographic records available on WikiAves show that the species is present all year round in RS and that there are even records of breeding activity between November and February (Belton, 1994; Maur�cio et al., 2013; WikiAves, 2016). It is also recorded for Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) from May to November, SP in August, PR in May, MT in September and SC from February to May and from October to December (Straube et al., 2006; WikiAves, 2016). Such data suggests that there are resident populations in RS and at least some migration to other states."
185,Anatidae,Anas georgica ,MPR:  ,marreca-parda,Yellow-billed Pintail,,," occurs from extreme southern Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, including the Malvinas/Falklands, South Georgia, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil as far as SP (Carboneras, 1992a), with occasional records for RR and CE (Sick, 1997). Individuals banded in Argentina were recovered in RS (Olrog, 1971) and one individual banded in RS was recovered on the Pacific coast of Chile, which suggests east-west movements (Silva, 1987). The main breeding site in Brazil is the coastal region and the highlands of RS. Thousands of individuals have been recorded near the border with Uruguay, where they molt between January and March (Antas, 1994). The wetlands of RS are used in migration routes (Antas, 1994), as well as its Central Depression (Nascimento et al., 2000). Photographic records show the presence of the species all year round in RS and SC, and records of breeding activity between June and December. It seems to occur in SP between July and October, and in Rio de Janeiro (RJ) in January and October (WikiAves, 2016)."
186,Anatidae,Anas versicolor ,MPR:  ,marreca-cricri,Silver Teal,,," occurs from Chile and Argentina to Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil (Sick, 1997). Populations that breed further south of the distribution migrate north during winter and reach southeastern Brazil (Carboneras, 1992a). Banding data proves the west-east migration   between Argentina and Brazil (Belton, 1984; Antas, 1994; Sick, 1997; SNA, 2016). The species seems to move in RS through a main corridor formed by coastal wetlands and the Central Depression, similar to Netta peposaca (Nascimento et al., 2000). Part of its population is present throughout the year from RS to SP, and there are records of breeding activity in September and October for RS, SC, PR (WikiAves, 2016), SP (F. Schunck, pers. comm.), and occasionally in RJ (Sick, 1997)."
187,Anatidae,Anas platalea ,MPR:  ,marreca-colhereira,Red Shoveler,,," occurs from southern South America to Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay and RS in Brazil, occasionally as far as RJ (Sick, 1997). Populations that breed further south of the general distribution migrate to lower latitudes during winter (Carboneras, 1992a). In RS, it occurs mainly as a winter visitor, though breeding has been confirmed in the state (Belton, 1984; FZBRS, 2013). Presents irregular records for MS, SP and PR (WikiAves, 2016)."
188,Anatidae,Netta peposaca ,MPR:  ,marrec�o,Rosy-billed Pochard,,," occurs in the Southern Cone of South America and, in Brazil, in wetlands and floodplains in RS and in the coastal zone of PR, SC, SP and RJ (Nascimento et al., 2000). Individuals from RS, where there is a resident population, come from different areas in Argentina and fly from the Paran� River delta near Buenos Aires almost to the Paran� and Paraguay Rivers junction (Belton, 1984; Antas, 1987; Sick, 1997), and then fly to the south coast of Brazil (Antas, 1994). The species flies along coastal lagoons in RS and reaches lower Paran�, which is its main breeding site, through eastern Uruguay or through the Central Depression of the state (Antas et al., 1990; Antas, 1994; Nascimento et al., 2000). The migration after breeding occurs from April to September and occasionally some individuals arrive in the Pantanal in MS (Nascimento et al., 2000). There are also historic records for RJ (J.F. Pacheco, pers. obs.). In SP, it has been recorded for the Tanqu� region in the municipality of Piracicaba all year round, and there is also evidence of breeding activity (WikiAves, 2016)."
189,Anatidae,Heteronetta atricapilla ,MPR:  ,marreca-de-cabe�a-preta,Black-headed Duck,,," occurs from Chile and Argentina to southern Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia (Sick, 1997). Populations that breed further south of the distribution fly north during winter (Carboneras, 1992a). Calabuig et al. (2010) suggest that this species presents the same pattern as Coscoroba coscoroba, in which part of the population migrates and the rest remain in one area throughout the year. Individuals that were banded in Santiago del Estero in June and then recovered in RS in August (Olrog, 1974) proved migration between Argentina and Brazil (RS). This species breeds in RS between October and December (Maur�cio et al., 2013)."
190,Procellariidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
191,Procellariidae,Pterodroma arminjoniana ,MPR:  ,grazina-de-trindade,Trindade Petrel,VU,CR," adults seem to be sedentary in great part of its distribution while immature individuals are more dispersive and can move through tropical and subtropical Atlantic waters. It breeds in Trindade and Martin Vaz (Carboneras, 1992c), but its   breeding is currently restricted to Trindade Island and other near islets (Neves et al., 2006). On Trindade, active nests and pairs doing flight displays can be seen all year round (Neves et al., 2006), but records of immature individuals are more common on the North Atlantic Ocean than in the South Atlantic (Abreu et al., 2010). There are, however, records of adults for the coast of Rio Grande do Norte (RN) in January 2015 (WikiAves, 2016) and of immature individuals for Argentina in July (Savigny et al., 2005) and for Uruguay in April (Abreu et al., 2010)."
194,Ardeidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
195,Ardeidae,Nyctanassa violacea ,MPR:  ,savacu-de-coroa,Yellow-crowned Night-Heron,,," occurs from the coast of the USA to northern Peru and Brazil in all coastal states from AP to RS (Sick, 1997; WikiAves, 2016). Movements from the subspecies N. v. cayennesis, which occurs in Brazil, are little known (Mart�nez-Vilalta & Motis, 1992). In the estuary from Lagoa dos Patos/RS, where it breeds, its occurrence is seasonal between August and April (Gianuca, 2007) and a large part of the population is absent from this state between April and August, when its main prey (the crab Neo? helice granulata) remains in its burrows (Mart�nez-Vilalta & Motis, 1992). There are other records for RS in September, October, November, December and February (Belton, 1984; WikiAves, 2016), which confirm the migratory pattern in the state even though it is present in all other states throughout the year (WikiAves, 2016)."
196,Threskiornithidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
197,Threskiornithidae,Plegadis chihi ,MPR:  ,cara�na,White-faced Ibis,,," occurs from central California and northwestern USA to the coast of Mexico, and in southern central South America from southeastern Bolivia, Paraguay and southern Brazil to Uruguay and northern central Chile and Argentina (Matheu & del Hoyo, 1992). In Brazil, it seems to breed only in RS and there is a record of 12,000 pairs in the Taim Ecological Station (Belton, 1984), where there are also records all year round, as well as in SC (P.P. Serafini, pers. obs.), PR and SP (WikiAves, 2016). However, banding and recapture data proves that this species migrates between Argentina and RS, and records for Argentina are centered in the period between January and April and for RS between June and December (Olrog, 1971; Belton, 1984; SNA, 2016)."
198,Threskiornithidae,Platalea ajaja ,MPR:  ,colhereiro,Roseate Spoonbill,,," occurs from southeastern USA to northern Argentina, and there are records in all of Brazil. It is considered sedentary in most of its global distribution, but it is partially migratory in North America and its movements in South America are little known (Matheu & Del Hoyo, 1992). In Brazil, it breeds in RS (September to December), where it is present throughout the year (Belton, 1994), and also in the Pantanal according to banding data (SNA, 2016). Nestlings and juveniles banded in RS were recovered in SC, SP, MG and RJ (Nunes & Tomas, 2008). This species was classified as partially migratory due to the fact that breeding data is restricted to RS and Pantanal, which suggests that this species returns to these places to breed."
200, Accipitridae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
201, Accipitridae,Elanoides forficatus ,MPR:  ,gavi�o-tesoura,Swallow-tailed Kite,,," occurs from the southeast coast of the USA to eastern Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina, and two subspecies are recognized: E. f. forfi? catus and E. f. yetapa, both which occurs in Brazil (Bierregaard & Kirwan, 2016a). There are records of breeding activity in the Brazilian territory for MT, TO, SP, PR, SC and RS between November and February (WikiAves, 2016). In the Amazon, where it also breeds, only one nest was recorded in the Upper Negro River (Thiollay, 1994). It is relatively common in most of its distribution and migratory in the extreme north and south of its global occurrence: chicks banded in Florida in June were recovered in PR in December and in MT in October and November (Sick, 1997). There are also records for RS between September and March (Belton, 1984). There is no doubt about its migratory behavior, but tracking studies should be performed due to the presence of both subspecies in Brazil sharing geographical areas for at least part of the year (B. Whitney, pers. obs.)."
202, Accipitridae,Ictinia plumbea ,MPR:  ,sovi,Plumbeous Kite,,," occurs from northeastern Mexico to western Ecuador, Paraguay and northern Argentina and Brazil (Bierregaard et al., 2016). It is migratory in the north and south of its global distribution (Jahn & Cueto, 2012), and the limits of its populations are not well known. Groups, probably of nomads, appear sporadically throughout the Amazon (Bierregaard et al., 2016) and are recorded in the region of Alter do Ch�o/PA only during the rainy season from February to July (Sanaiotti & Cintra, 2001). In Brazil, this species occurs sporadically in the Northeast and it breeds in the Amazon and in the Central-West, Southeast and South regions. For PR, SC and RS, records are restricted to the period between August and April (WikiAves, 2016; MNRJ; MZUSP). Therefore, there is a resident and a migratory population in the Brazilian national territory."
203, Accipitridae,Rostrhamus sociabilis ,MPR:  ,gavi�o-caramujeiro,Snail Kite,,," occurs from southeastern USA to northeastern Argentina and populations from the south of the global distribution are migratory (Sick, 1997). This species performs nomadic movements triggered by drought or drainage of its feeding areas (Bierregaard & Kirwan, 2016b). It departs from the southern region of Brazil in April and returns in September, and some individuals fly to the Pantanal, where they form groups of up to 600 individuals in feeding areas (Bierregaard & Kirwan, 2016). There is no record of breeding in the Pantanal and large groups (40-80) have been seen departing from the central area and heading south (Antas, 1994). In the Paraguay River, it is more common in October, when it flies south in flocks (Thiollay, 1994). There are records of flocks of about 1,000 individuals flying from the north to the south over Sapucaia do Sul/RS in October 1976 (Sick, 1983). In October 2010, a flock of thousands of individuals (between 2,500 and 3,000) was seen flying from the north to the south in Chapada dos Guimar�es/MT (P.P. Amaral, pers. obs.). There are records of breeding activity for CE, Alagoas (AL), Piau� (PI), Esp�rito Santo (ES), RJ and  RS, where the species has been recorded in all months of the year (WikiAves, 2016), as well as in MG and SP (L.F. Silveira, pers. obs.)."
205,Rallidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
206,Rallidae,Pardirallus sanguinolentus ,MPR:  ,saracura-do-banhado,Plumbeous Rail,,," occurs in Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and the southeastern and southern regions of Brazil (Taylor, 1996). It breeds in RS (Belton, 1994; Maur�cio et al., 2013), SC, PR, SP and RJ (WikiAves, 2016). The population from southwestern Pampas seems to migrate north during winter, while populations from the Atlantic coast and coastal swamps are sedentary (Taylor, 1996). Records for western RS � in the municipalities of Quara�, Alegrete and Uruguaiana � are restricted to the period between May and September (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP)."
207,Rallidae,Porphyrio martinicus ,MPR:  ,frango-d'�gua-azul,Purple Gallinule,,," occurs from southeastern USA to Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay, northern Argentina and all of Brazil (Taylor, 1996; Grantsau, 2010). Although the literature indicates that this species moves seasonally in northeastern Brazil (Sick, 1983), photographic records (WikiAves, 2016) and banding data (SNA, 2016) do not corroborate this pattern. There are scarce records of breeding activity in the entire Northeast region from January to October, and also in CE, Pernambuco (PE) and BA throughout the year (WikiAves, 2016). Populations from the extreme south of the distribution (Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil) fly north during austral winter (Taylor, 1996), when they disappear completely (Sick, 1997) from the RS, where records are restricted to the period between September and May (Belton, 1984; MZUSP 637 [RS, 1897, October]), when they also breed (Maur�cio et al., 2013). As the species is recorded virtually all year round in SC (WikiAves, 2016), migration seems to be restricted to RS."
208,Charadriidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
209,Charadriidae,Charadrius falklandicus ,MPR:  ,batu�ra-de-coleira-dupla,Two-banded Plover,,," migrates after breeding from Patagonia to Uruguay, RS and the Southeast region of Brazil (Wiersma, 1996). It has a resident population in RS, where breeding has also been recorded (Belton, 1984; Sick, 1997; Maur�cio et al., 2013). For SP, there are records in May to August (Barbieri et al., 2013; WikiAves, 2016). There are also records for SC between May and July (WikiAves, 2016)."
210,Sternidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
211,Sternidae,Sternula antillarum ,MPR:  ,trinta-r�is-mi�do,Least Tern,,," breeds from April to July on the east coast of the USA, it migrates to the Caribbean and South America, and overwinters mainly in Brazil (Gochfeld & Burger, 1996) according to data from two individuals banded in the USA and recovered in AL in January (Olmos, 2002a). However, there is a breeding colony on Curupu Island/MA monitored between May and July (Rodrigues et al., 2010) that suggests that there are possibly two populations in Brazil and their limits are not yet known. This way, occurrence data in Brazil may include birds both from the Brazilian populations and migrants from the Northern Hemisphere. There are records for AP between October and April (Xavier & Boss, 2011; WikiAves, 2016) that are probably individuals from North America, and for PA between May and October (Valente, 2011; WikiAves, 2016; MPEG) that would belong to the Brazilian population. In the Northeast region, there are records or BA (Lima, 2006), PE (Azevedo-J�nior & Larraz�bal, 2011a), SE and AL (Azevedo-J�nior & Larraz�bal, 2011b), from September to May (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP), which suggests that these are records of the north population. Records for CE, RN (Gir�o et al., 2008; Albano & Gir�o, 2011; Gir�o & Albano, 2011a) and MA are distributed in all months of the year (WikiAves, 2016), which suggests that there is an overlap of migratory and resident individuals. In RS, records are probably of migrants and from November to April (WikiAves, 2016)."
212,Sternidae,Gelochelidon nilotica ,MPR:  ,trinta-r�is-de-bico-preto,Gull-billed Tern,,," occurs in tropical and subtropical seas in all continents. Birds from eastern USA migrate to southeastern USA and to the Gulf of Mexico. Some individuals cross to the Pacific, while others overwinter along Costa Rica or reach southern Brazil and Peru (Gochfeld & Burger, 1996). It is usually not common in most of Brazil and its distribution is disjunct and centered in two different areas: through the coast from the estuary of the Amazon River (including Mexiana and Maraj� islands/PA) to RN; and in coastal lagoons, rice fields and swamps in southern Brazil (RS), and this second population is contiguous to the ones in Uruguay and Argentina. There are few records of breeding activity in Brazil (De Luca et al., 2006), and most records of nesting are old. This species nests in the estuary of the Amazon River in August (Sick, 1997) and in RS between November and January (Belton, 1994). Photographic records confirm the disjunct distribution pattern and show its presence in the Northeast all year round, which suggests that part of the Brazilian population is resident, but records in RS are restricted from September to May (WikiAves, 2016). There are also documented records in inland Brazil, such as in MG (N�brega et al., 2015) and in the Amazon River channel, where it might breed (Kirwan et al., 2012)."
213,Sternidae,Sterna hirundinacea ,MPR:  ,trinta-r�is-de-bico-vermelho,South American Tern,,VU," occurs from the south coast of Peru and southeastern Brazil to Tierra del Fuego and on the Malvinas/Falklands. During winter, its distribution expands further north to southern Ecuador on the Pacific coast and to BA on the Atlantic coast (Gochfeld & Burger, 1996). There are two breeding populations on the Atlantic coast. The population from southern Uruguay and Argentina breeds every year from December to February during austral summer and then migrates north and arrives in Brazil from April to May to winter possibly between the coast of RJ and southern BA. The Brazilian population from SC to ES begins breeding activities in April-May (Antas, 1987). There are also records of breeding activity on coastal islands from RJ (Coelho et al., 1990) and SC (Branco, 2003). Museum records are restricted to June to September in RJ (MZUSP, MNRJ, MPEG), to July to October and April in SP and to August in RS (MZUSP)."
215,Sternidae,Sterna trudeaui ,MPR:  ,trinta-r�is-de-coroa-branca,Snowy-crowned Tern,,," occurs on the coast of and in inland South America, and breeds from southern Brazil to Patagonia and Chile (Gochfeld & Burger, 1996). There is evidence of breeding activity in RS (Sick, 1997) in November and December (WikiAves, 2016), where it is considered resident (Belton, 1984; Accordi & Hartz, 2013). Out of the breeding season, it flies north through the Pacific coast to southern Peru and through the Atlantic coast to RJ (Gochfeld & Burger, 2016a). Photographic records suggest it is present on the Brazilian coast from RS to northern SP, but records for SP are restricted between May and November, for PR from July to November, and for RS in August (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP)."
216,Sternidae,Thalasseus acuflavidus ,MPR:  ,trinta-r�is-de-bando,Cabot's Tern,,," occurs in eastern North America, Antilles and Caribbean and overwinters from the southern Caribbean to southern Peru and Uruguay (Gochfeld & Burger, 2016b). Individuals from North America migrate south across the Caribbean and over the coasts from both Central and South America (Gochfeld & Burger, 2016b). In Brazil, this species breeds on coastal islands in the South and Southeast regions, and the largest breeding colony of the South Atlantic is in ES with around 14,000 individuals (M.A. Efe, pers. comm.). In RS, (Accordi & Hartz, 2013) and BA, it can be observed all year round, but there are large gatherings of individuals on the coast of BA from September to April originated from breeding colonies in ES according to banding data (Lima et al., 2004b). Although this species is considered migratory by Jahn & Cueto (2012), available data shows it is only partially migratory."
217,Sternidae,Thalasseus maximus ,MPR:  ,trinta-r�is-real,Royal Tern,,EN," occurs from the southwest coast of the USA to northwestern Mexico and from eastern USA to the Guianas and Brazil, through the Antilles and Bahamas. Its breeding populations are disjunct and occur in the Yucat�n Peninsula and in southern Brazil, Uruguay and northern Patagonia (Gochfeld & Burger, 1996). Individuals that arrive in Brazil come from southern USA and Caribbean and land in the north and northeast coasts during austral summer, and also individuals that come from Patagonia during austral winter (De Luca et al., 2006). There are records of this species all year round in Ilha Comprida/SP both of breeding individuals and of those originating from southern South America (Barbieri & Paes, 2008). Although this species have had been considered resident in RS (Accordi & Hartz, 2013), its records are scarce from October to December, which suggests return to breeding colonies further south of the continent in this period (Belton, 1984), confirming the migratory behavior as already proposed by Jahn & Cueto (2012)."
218,Rynchopidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
219,Rynchopidae,Rynchops niger ,MPR:  ,talha-mar,Black Skimmer,,," occurs as resident in some coastal areas in eastern USA, Mexico and northern South America; occurs as migrant in the coast of South America, Central America and part of the USA. It breeds in the Amazon and in great part of central and eastern Brazil (Zusi, 1996). This species is recorded in Brazil all year round, but evidence of breeding activity seems to be restricted to RS, the Amazonian and Central-West regions, specifically in AM, PA, RO, TO, MT, MS, GO (WikiAves, 2016). Data from banding and recapture suggests that nestlings born in the Pantanal in MT and in the Manaus region/ AM fly to southern Brazil in RS, to Uruguay and Argentina (SNA, 2016). During a one-year study in the estuary of Canan�ia-Iguape-Ilha Comprida/SP, this species was present in all months exhibited no evidence of breeding activity and presented population fluctuations (Barbieri, 2007). Although the available data is still not enough to define a migratory pattern, the fact that this species only breeds in the aforementioned places suggests the existence of migratory movement."
220,Caprimulgidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
221,Caprimulgidae,Lurocalis semitorquatus ,MPR:  ,tuju,Short-tailed Nighthawk,,," occurs from southern Mexico to northern Argentina (Cleere, 1999). There are records of breeding activity of the subspecies L. s. nattereri in lowland Atlantic Forest in SP between September and March, and of it departing from this area between April and August (Aleixo & Galetti, 1997). In the Carlos Botelho State Park/SP, it has been considered locally migratory and its records are centered in the period between September and April (Antunes et al., 2013), which also happens with its photographic records for the entire South and Southeast regions � RJ, SP, PR, SC, RS (WikiAves, 2016). The species seems to fly to regions further north of the country during winter, including the Amazon, where there is a resident population (L. s. semitorquatus) that gathers with migratory populations. Important vocal distinctions possibly prevent population cross-breeding during the wintering season of L. s. nattereri in the Amazon (T.V.V. Costa, pers. comm.). Museum data confirms the described pattern once records for South and Southeast regions are restricted to the period of September to April (MZUSP, MPEG, MNRJ) and for Amazonian region all over the year (MZUSP, MPEG)."
222,Caprimulgidae,Hydropsalis parvula ,MPR:  ,bacurau-chint�,Little Nightjar,,," occurs from eastern Peru to northern Argentina and Uruguay and all through Brazil, especially south of the Amazon River. The species seems to be migratory in Brazil (Cleere, 1999) and is present in the Central-West, Southeast and South regions especially between September and April, and in the Amazon, where it overwinters, it is restricted between April and August. In the Northeast, it seems to be present all year round. There are records of breeding activity for GO, DF, MT, MS, MG, CE, BA, AL, SE, ES, RJ, SP, PR (WikiAves, 2016) and RS (Belton, 1984)."
223,Caprimulgidae,Podager nacunda ,MPR:  ,coruc�o,Nacunda Nighthawk,,," the subspecies P. n. nacunda breeds in temperate and tropical regions in South America and migrates to hotter, more humid regions in the continent (Azpiroz et al., 2012), where it joins the resident taxon P. n. minor (Barbosa et al., 2015). Its migratory pattern is less known (Cleere, 1999) and the overlap of the two subspecies makes it harder to differentiate records of the migratory from those of the resident population. There are records for almost the entire Brazilian territory and they are distributed in all months of the year, while evidence of breeding activity is restricted to PA, TO, GO, RJ, SP, PR and RS between September and December (WikiAves, 2016)."
224,Trochilidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
225,Trochilidae,Florisuga fusca ,MPR:  ,beija-flor-preto,Black Jacobin,,," occurs in southeastern Paraguay, northeastern Argentina, northern Uruguay and part of Brazil (Schuchmann, 1999). It breeds on mountains in southeastern Brazil and migrates altitudinally, moving to lower grounds during winter. It is a regular winter visitor in the province of Misiones in Argentina and rare in eastern Paraguay (Areta & Bodrati, 2010). In Brazil, there are records in all months of the year in the Southeast, the South, and in BA. In GO and MS, records are centered in the period between April and October. Breeding activity (November to March) has an altitudinal tendency, and most records come from elevations higher than 600 m (WikiAves, 2016). Further studies are necessary to better understand its migratory patterns."
226,Trochilidae,Anthracothorax nigricollis ,MPR:  ,beija-flor-de-veste-preta,Black-throated Mango,,," occurs from Panama to northeastern Argentina and southern Brazil. It migrates to higher elevations in August and September and long-distance migration in eastern Brazil is also known (Schuchmann, 1999). There is one record of breeding activity in lowland Atlantic Forest in SP between September and March, and it departs from this region between April and August (Aleixo & Galetti, 1997). The species has been recorded in Carlos Botelho State Park/SP from October to April (Antunes et al., 2013), and is considered locally migratory. According to photographic and banding records, it occurs in the Amazon all year round, where it breeds from April to July. This species seems to vanish from RJ, PR and RS during winter (from May to July), and from ES in June and July. Although there are records for SP during winter, its numbers are low. Records of breeding activity in the South and Southeast are restricted to lower elevations (under 600 m) and centered in the period between October and February (SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016). This described pattern is confirmed by museum data (MZUSP, MPEG, MNRJ) although the presence of two isolated records in the winter: in MG in June (MZUSP 97891) and in RJ in July (MNRJ 41474)."
227,Tityridae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
228,Tityridae,Pachyramphus polychopterus ,MPR:  ,caneleiro-preto,White-winged Becard,,," occurs from Guatemala to eastern Brazil and northern Argentina (Mobley, 2016). There are records of breeding activity in lowland Atlantic Forest areas in SP between September and March, and records for the Carlos Botelho State Park/SP are restricted between September and April (Antunes et al., 2013). It seems to depart from southeastern SP in April (Aleixo & Galetti, 1997), which is corroborated by data from the Southeast and South regions, where records are centered in the period between September and April (Belton, 1985; WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG; MNRJ). In the Northeast, Central-West and Amazonian regions, records are distributed in all months of the year (WikiAves, 2016)."
229,Tityridae,Pachyramphus validus ,MPR:  ,caneleiro-de-chap�u-preto,Crested Becard,,," occurs from southern Peru and eastern Bolivia to northern Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil (Mobley, 2016) on Maraj� Island and eastern PA, and from RO to RS. Joseph (1996) classified it as migratory, but this is not a consensus in literature. It breeds in lowland Atlantic Forest areas in SP between September and March and it seems it departs from this region between April and August (Aleixo & Galetti, 1997). Analyses of data from WikiAves, museums and SNA show a reduced number of records in the colder months (from May to July) in the states from the Southeast and South, and its absence from SC and RS (Belton, 1985; WikiAves, 2016; SNA, 2016; MZUSP, MPEG, MNRJ), which shows that the species exhibit migratory movement. Although further studies are necessary to better understand its migratory pattern in all Brazilian territory."
230,Tyrannidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
231,Tyrannidae,Elaenia spectabilis ,MPR:  ,guaracava-grande,Large Elaenia,,," breeds from the eastern Andes in Bolivia to southwestern and eastern Brazil, northern Argentina and Uruguay; it overwinters in northeastern Brazil and in the Amazon (Hosner, 2004a). Museum and sound records show its sparse presence throughout the year in almost the entire national territory. Records for Amazonian states are restricted in the period between April and November and centered between May and August (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MNRJ; MPEG). The records from the South region (PR, SC and RS) are restricted to September and March (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG), which suggests a migratory pattern. However, there is only evidence of breeding activity for the Northeast, Southeast and South regions between September and April (WikiAves, 2016) indicating why this species was classified as partially migratory."
232,Tyrannidae,Elaenia parvirostris ,MPR:  ,tuque-pium,Small-billed Elaenia,,," breeds in eastern and southeastern Bolivia, southeastern and southern Brazil, northeastern Argentina and Uruguay. After breeding, it migrates during winter (April to October) mainly to northern South America, crossing the entire Amazon and flying as far as southern Caribbean (Netherlands Antilles, Trinidad) (Fitzpatrick, 2004). Available records, vocal and museum, corroborate this pattern: those for the Amazonian region are restricted to the period between April and October, while those for Southeast and South are centered from August to March (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG). Breeding data for the Southeast and South are between October and February (WikiAves, 2016)."
233,Tyrannidae,Elaenia chiriquensis ,MPR:  ,chibum,Lesser Elaenia,,," occurs from Costa Rica to eastern Brazil and northeastern Argentina. It is considered resident in most of its distribution (Hosner, 2004b), but some individuals migrate to breed (Jahn et al., 2004). The coexistence of migratory and resident populations  hinders the identification of flyways (Marini & Cavalcanti, 1990). There seems to be a population quite common in Central Brazil between August and December that also breeds there and fly north during winter (Hosner, 2004b; Medeiros & Marini, 2007) and west to the Amazonian region (Sick, 1983, 1997; Marini & Cavalcanti, 1990). This migratory pattern is corroborated by an absence of records south of Bras�lia/DF and Cuiab�/MT between June and August (Marini & Cavalcanti, 1990). Nevertheless, a study using stable isotope analysis of tissues of individuals from this population reveals that individuals never leave the Cerrado for molting and wintering (Guaraldo et al., 2016). In addition, unpublished data from Charles G. Duca reports a quick passage of individuals through the coast of ES in February that were molting flight feathers, which suggests that the southeast coast of Brazil may be a stopover or molting ground for this species."
236,Tyrannidae,Myiopagis viridicata ,MPR:  ,guaracava-de-crista-alaranjada,Greenish Elaenia,,," occurs from Mexico to Venezuela and Ecuador, also in Guyana, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and virtually all of Brazil. It is mainly resident, but populations in extreme southern Brazil migrate north after the breeding season (Fitzpatrick, 2004). Photographic records restricted to the period between September and May in PR, SC and RS corroborate this, while in other states it is found throughout the year (Belton, 1985; WikiAves, 2016)."
237,Tyrannidae,Serpophaga munda ,MPR:  ,alegrinho-de-barriga-branca,White-bellied Tyrannulet,,," breeds in Argentina between October and January and flies to lower elevations, to the north and east of the Chaco and to Patagonian lowlands during austral winter, with some individuals flying to coastal regions in southeastern of Brazil and Uruguay (Fitzpatrick, 2004). It migrates every year from the Andes to the Pantanal during colder periods (D. Oliveira, pers. comm.), as shown by recaptures in the Pantanal Matogrossense National Park in June 2013 (Cemave, unpublished data). All photographic and sound records available are for RS and are distributed throughout the year (WikiAves, 2016), which suggests a resident population (even though there is no evidence of breeding activity). Because of its migratory behavior in the Pantanal, this species was considered partially migratory."
238,Tyrannidae,Legatus leucophaius ,MPR:  ,bem-te-vi-pirata,Piratic Flycatcher,,," occurs from Mexico to northern Argentina and in all of Brazil (Mobley & Kirwan, 2016). It has been considered a migratory species (Jahn & Cueto, 2012), and records for the northeastern, southeastern and southern regions are centered in the period between September and March (Belton, 1985; Antunes et al., 2013; WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MNRJ). However, the species is recorded all year round for the northern region (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG) and there is evidence of breeding activity for all of Brazil between September and February (WikiAves, 2016), which characterizes it as a partially migratory species."
239,Tyrannidae,Myiarchus swainsoni ,MPR:  ,irr�,Swainson's Flycatcher,,," the subspecies M. s. swain? soni occurs in the most meridional regions of South America, breeds in the temperate zones of Argentinaand overwinters in northern South America (Sick, 1997; Joseph, 2004; Cueto et al., 2008). In Brazil, it breeds in RS (Belton, 1985; Maur�cio et al., 2013), where it is considered an austral migrant (Accordi & Hartz, 2013). Photographic, museum records and banding data in RS are centered on the period between September and April (Belton, 1985; SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP) as well as for SC and PR (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP). In SP, it has been regarded as migratory (Willis, 2004; Silva-e-Silva & Olmos, 2007; Antunes et al., 2013), but photographic records and banding data show its presence in all months of the year (SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016). Sedentary populations may be represented by the subspecies M. s. pelzelni in Central Brazil (Lanyon, 1982), but preliminary data and capture records suggest a migratory pattern for this subspecies around Bras�lia/DF, as seen as the result of a pilot project with geolocators and isotopic analyses in Bras�lia and in Chapada dos Guimar�es/MT (A. Guaraldo, pers. obs.)."
240,Tyrannidae,Casiornis fuscus ,MPR:  ,caneleiro-enxofre,Ash-throated Casiornis,,," endemic to Brazil and occurs in the southern Amazon from lower Tapaj�s River east to PE and south to northeastern MT and central MG, including the entire Caatinga and part of the Cerrado (Scholes, 2004; Scholes & Boesman, 2016). As stated by Sick (1997), it seems to be present in the north of its distribution only as a visitor during winter. This statement was recently confirmed and deepened a space-time analysis of historic records of museum specimens, field observations and digital vouchers at WikiAves and e?bird (Lees, 2016). In this analysis, a migratory pattern from part of the Caatinga and adjacent ecotones was identified, where records are centered in the period between December and March, expanding west to northern Cerrado and eastern Amazon between June and September. Although it can be recorded throughout the year in the Caatinga, where it also breeds, as corroborated by banding data (SNA, 2016), its occurrence in the Amazon is restricted to the period between April and October, when they use mainly open formations and young secondary forests as wintering areas (Lees, 2016)."
241,Tyrannidae,Pitangus sulphuratus ,MPR:  ,bem-te-vi,Great Kiskadee,,," occurs from extreme southern USA to Argentina. Its migratory habits are little known and it is resident in most of its distribution. It seems to depart from higher altitudes and colder regions in southern Brazil during austral winter (Mobley, 2004a). One individual banded in Santiago del Estero, Argentina was recovered in SC in January (Olrog, 1969). There are large numbers of this species in Serra da Bodoquena in western MS during winter and then it disappears during summer, which suggests a west-east movement through the Argentinian Chaco region to Brazil (Capllonch et al., 2009). During a banding course in the Pantanal Matogrossense National Park in July 2013, 11 individuals were captured simultaneously in two mist nets (Cemave, unpublished data). However, further studies are necessary to better understand this species movement patterns."
242,Tyrannidae,Myiodynastes maculatus ,MPR:  ,bem-te-vi-rajado,Streaked Flycatcher,,," occurs from Mexico to Argentina and in all of Brazil (Mobley, 2004b). It is considered migratory (Jahn & Cueto, 2012) in the extreme north and south of its distribution and seems to move altitudinally (Mobley, 2004b), but this is yet to be confirmed. It breeds in almost all of Brazil from September to April (SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016) and, according to Sick (1983), it departs from southern regions in the winter to join the sedentary populations from the north (Sick, 1983). Photographic records (WikiAves, 2016) and banding data (SNA, 2016) confirm its presence all year round in all of Brazil, but in the southeastern and southern regions they are centered in the period between September and April, which suggests a winter migration that should be better studied. Central-western records are far more numerous in the period of August to December (WikiAves, 2016)."
243,Tyrannidae,Tyrannus albogularis ,MPR:  ,suiriri-de-garganta-branca,White-throated Kingbird,,," occurs from Venezuela to the Guianas south to northern Bolivia and Brazil. It has been classified as an austral migrant, but its movement pattern is not fully known and populations further north of the distribution may be resident. During austral winter (approximately from May to August), it migrates west through the Amazon, reaching extreme southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador and northeastern Peru (Mobley, 2004c). Photographic records and banding data show that the species breeds in Brazil between October and April in PA, RN, TO, GO, MG and SP. Its occurrence records are sparse throughout the year in the national territory (SNA, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG). However, there are fewer records in GO, MG and SP between May and August than in the rest of the year (SNA, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG), which suggests a reduction in population during winter. Further studies are necessary to understand its migratory pattern."
244,Tyrannidae,Tyrannus melancholicus ,MPR:  ,suiriri,Tropical Kingbird,,," occurs from extreme southwestern USA to central Argentina and in all of Brazil (Mobley, 2004d). Populations from southern Brazil remain in their breeding area only during the hotter months of the year and depart during winter (Sick, 1997), which classifies it as migratory (Jahn & Cueto, 2012) in part of its distribution (Mobley, 2004d). Museum records and banding data are restricted to the period between October and March in PR, SC and RS, and in MG, RJ and SP it is centered on September to March, when there are far more records (Belton, 1985; Accordi & Hartz, 2013; SNA, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG). However, the species is recorded all year round in the entire national territory and there is an overlap of resident and migrant populations, whose individuals can be morphologically differentiated by their wings (Jahn et al., 2010). Evidence of breeding activity is available for almost all Brazilian states (SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016)."
245,Tyrannidae,Tyrannus savana ,MPR:  ,tesourinha,Fork-tailed Flycatcher,,," occurs from southern Mexico to Argentina and all of Brazil, with both resident and migratory populations, whose movement patterns are not fully understood (Mobley, 2004e). It breeds in Argentina and southern Brazil from September to February and then flies north in flocks (Sick, 1983; Belton, 1985; Cueto et al., 2008; Azpiroz et al., 2012). It overwinters in the Amazon, but not always does the entire population migrate. During the non-breeding season (March to September), individuals of meridional populations invade areas of the sedentary septentrional populations. This species migrates in flocks that use different pathways to fly to and from the Amazon Basin, where they gather by the hundreds or even thousands (Sick, 1997). Three pairs captured in their breeding territory in Argentina and monitored by geolocators bred from late November to mid-January, started fall migration between late January and late February, and then migrated to the northwest, heading to northern South America and using one or two wintering grounds. Five individuals stayed in the western Amazon (mainly in Peru, northwestern Brazil and southern Colombia) for several weeks in April and May before flying to spend the rest of the non-breeding season in central Venezuela and northern Brazil. Fall migration lasted between 7 and 12 weeks and covered a distance of 2,888 to 4,105 km (Jahn et al., 2013b). According to photographic records and banding data, it occurs in the southeastern and southern regions of Brazil only from September to March, when it breeds (Belton, 1985; SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016). According to the literature, in the Amazonian region, it occurs all year round but it is but it is represented by both resident and migratory individuals (SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016). It has been recently discovered through geolocation data that individuals breeding in SP overwinter mainly in Colombia and Venezuela (Jahn et al., 2016)."
246,Tyrannidae,Griseotyrannus aurantioatrocristatus ,MPR:  ,peitica-de-chap�u-preto,Crowned Slaty Flycatcher,,," breeds in temperate zones in Argentina and migrates during austral winter to hotter, more humid latitudes in South America (Cueto et al., 2008). Part of its population is migratory and part is resident (Jahn et al., 2004). The nominotypical subspecies breeds in northern and eastern Bolivia, central-western and southern Brazil, northern and central Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay; is migratory and flies mainly to western Amazonia. During the non-breeding season, it is recorded in northeastern Peru, eastern Ecuador, southeastern Colombia, Brazil � in AC, RO, AM and PA �, extreme southern Venezuela and southern Guyana. The subspecies G. a. pallidiventris occurs from eastern PA to MA and PI and in GO (Mobley, 2004g) and is sedentary. In Brazil, photographic records showing evidence of breeding activity are scarce and they are restricted to the period between October and December in BA, GO, MG, SP (WikiAves, 2016) and RS (Belton, 1985). Occurrence records and banding data show its presence in central-western, southeastern and southern regions between September and January, while in the Amazonian region it can be observed throughout the year (SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016), probably due to the existence of a resident population and a seasonal increment of migratory individuals."
247,Tyrannidae,Empidonomus varius ,MPR:  ,peitica,Variegated Flycatcher,,,"   occurs in almost the entire continent of South America (except in the Andes and extreme south of the continent), and is migratory in the west and south of its distribution (Fitzpatrick, 2004).  Brazil, two subspecies occur: E. v. rufino, in Venezuela, Guianas, northern and eastern Brazil; and E. v. varius, in Bolivia, central and southern Brazil, northern Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, which seems to be migratory (Mobley, 2004h). Photographic records show evidence of breeding activity in the Amazonian region and in the northeastern, southeastern and southern regions from October to February (WikiAves, 2016). This, alongside banding data, shows its presence all year round in the northern region (SNA, 2016). In Caatinga regions in Northeast Brazil, its occurrence may be related to the rainy season, when there is a larger concentration of individuals between December and June. This pattern should be studied further. In the central-western, southeastern and southern regions, the species occurs mainly between September and April (SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP), as already stated in the literature for SP (Aleixo & Galetti, 1997; Willis, 2004; Antunes et al., 2013) and RS (Belton, 1985). It seems to fly to the northern region during winter (Sick, 1983), where the resident population receives an increment of migrant individuals."
250,Tyrannidae,Myiophobus fasciatus ,MPR:  ,filipe,Bran-colored Flycatcher,,," occurs from Costa Rica to northeastern Argentina, and is recorded in all of Brazil. It is resident, but there are migratory populations in the south of its distribution (Farnsworth & Lebbin, 2004e). In Brazil, it breeds in RS (Maur�cio et al., 2013), where it is considered migratory (Accordi & Hartz, 2013). Banding data and photographic records show its presence in this state between September and April, and only two individuals were banded outside of this period (one in May and another in June). In all other states the species is present all year round (SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016)."
251,Tyrannidae,Sublegatus modestus ,MPR:  ,guaracava-modesta,Southern Scrub-Flycatcher,,," migratory in the south of its distribution. Populations that breed in Argentina migrate to the Amazon during winter (Robbins, 2004; Cueto et al., 2008; Capllonch et al., 2009). Records for RS are restricted to the western region and are centered in the summer from October to February with evidence of breeding activity (Belton, 1985), despite a specific record in June (WikiAves, 2016). Photographic records and banding data are pretty scarce for the Amazon Basin (SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016), but they are restricted to the period between April and August in AC, RO, AP and the Amazonian region in MT, which confirms the migratory pattern suggested in the literature (WikiAves, 2016). It is still not securely known if the Amazonian populations are exclusively composed of austral migrants (Sick, 1997) or if there is a resident population in there. Studies with this species in this region are necessary."
252,Tyrannidae,Pyrocephalus rubinus ,MPR:  ,pr�ncipe,Vermilion Flycatcher,,," occurs from southern USA to south-central South America, and it is migratory in most of its distribution. It breeds in southeastern Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Argentina, Uruguay and southeastern and southern Brazil, and it overwinters mainly east of the Andes north to as far as southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, northeastern Peru and the Brazilian Amazon (Fitzpatrick, 1980; Sick, 1983; Jahn et al., 2004; Farnsworth & Lebbin, 2004f). In other areas, it moves altitudinally (Fitzpatrick, 2004). Adults from the population that breeds in Argentina depart to Ecuador and Colombia immediately after breeding, while the young remain for three more months and depart only when winter is near, in late April. Populations from southern Brazil migrate during winter and invade areas from resident populations in Central Brazil and in the Amazon (Sick, 1997). The species breeds in RS (Belton, 1985; Maur�cio et al., 2013) and PR (WikiAves, 2016). Photographic records show its presence all year round in almost the entire Brazilian territory, except for the Northeast, where there are records only for BA between May and November (WikiAves, 2016). In RS, records are also distributed in the entire year, but they are scarce from May to July (WikiAves, 2016)."
253,Tyrannidae,Fluvicola albiventer ,MPR:  ,lavadeira-de-cara-branca,Black-backed Water-Tyrant,,," breeds from northern central and eastern Brazil to eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Argentina and western Uruguay. It occurs as a winter migrant in the western Brazilian Amazon, southeastern Peru, northern Bolivia. There are few records for northeastern Peru and is alsoVAGrant in Ecuador (Farnsworth & Langham, 2004b). In Brazil, according to photographic records (WikiAves, 2016) and banding data (SNA, 2016), the species seems to be resident in the Southeast and Northeast regions. Records are scarce in the south of the country and they seem to be centered in the period between July and December for the Amazonian region, even though in AM it was also recorded in January and February (SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG). Its seasonality in the Amazon was important for its classification as partially migratory, but moving patterns are not well defined and further studies are necessary."
254,Tyrannidae,Lathrotriccus euleri ,MPR:  ,enferrujado,Euler's Flycatcher,,," occurs in Venezuela, Colombia, Guianas, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and the entire Brazil. It is mainly resident, but populations from the south migrate north during winter (Farnsworth & Lebbin, 2004g) in July, and return in January (Joseph, 1996). According to photographic records, the species is present in the Southeast and Central-West regions all year round and records are scattered along the year without an apparent pattern. In the South (PR, SC and RS), the species vanishes during winter, especially in June and July (WikiAves, 2016). In RS, data from band recovery suggests fidelity to site and period (Belton, 1985)."
255,Tyrannidae,Hymenops perspicillatus ,MPR:  ,viuvinha-de-�culos,Spectacled Tyrant,,," occurs in Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia and Brazil. It is resident in part of southern Brazil, but migratory in the southeast, moving north during winter (Farnsworth & Lebbin, 2004h) and remaining in the breeding area only in the hotter months of the year (Sick, 1997). This species is recorded all year round for RS and SC (WikiAves, 2016), which indicate that it is resident in these states (Belton, 1985). However, records for PR, SP, RJ, MS and MT are restricted to the period between April and November (WikiAves, 2016)."
256,Vireonidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
257,Vireonidae,Vireo chivi ,MPR:  ,juruviara,Chivi Vireo,,," breeds between late September and early April in central western and southern Peru, Brazil � in BA, GO, MT, RJ, SP, PR, SC and RS (WikiAves, 2016) �, west-central Paraguay and northern Argentina as far as Buenos Aires, between 15�S and 36�S (Capllonch & Wagner, 2009; Brewer & Orenstein, 2010). In SP, records are restricted to the period between September and March (Aleixo & Galetti, 1997; Machado, 1997; Willis, 2004; Antunes et al., 2013; MZUSP), as well as in PR (Vallejos et al., 2011; MZUSP), the Pantanal (Nunes & Tomas, 2008), and MS (Nunes et al., 2011). In PE, records are centered in the period between October and February (W. Telino-J�nior, pers. obs.), while in SE it has been recorded only in December (Ruiz-Esparza et al., 2011). For RS, there are records between September and May (Belton, 1985) and for RJ all year round, but it is usually silent between April and August as it follows mixed-species flocks (J.F. Pacheco, pers. obs.). After breeding, it moves to the Amazon and southern Venezuela, where it remains during austral winter (Capllonch & Wagner, 2009; Brewer & Orenstein, 2010). Its wintering areas are little known, but there are reports for Jaragu�/GO and Chapada dos Guimar�es/MT (Capllonch & Wagner, 2009)."
258,Hirundinidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
259,Hirundinidae,Stelgidopteryx ruficollis ,MPR:  ,andorinha-serradora,Southern Rough-winged Swallow,,," occurs from Costa Rica to northeastern Argentina; it seems to be resident in the north and migratory in the south of its distribution, forming large flocks after the breeding season (Turner, 2004). The only subspecies in Brazil, S. r. ruficollis, occurs in southeastern Colombia, eastern Venezuela, Guianas and Brazil to eastern Peru, Bolivia, northern and northeastern Argentina and Uruguay. It has been recorded in Colombia and Suriname during the non-breeding season and it seems to also occur in neighboring countries. However, its distribution during the non-breeding season is still unknown (Turner, 2016b). This species seems to occur in tropical, hot, humid lowlands during winter in the Southern Hemisphere and fly between breeding areas in January, and non-breeding areas in July (Joseph, 1996). In Brazil, according to photographic records and banding data, it is resident in almost the entire national territory, except for RS (Accordi & Hartz, 2013) and SC, from where it vanishes in June and July (SNA, 2016; WikiAves, 2016)."
260,Hirundinidae,Progne tapera ,MPR:  ,andorinha-do-campo,Brown-chested Martin,,," activity in BA, MS, GO, MG, RJ, SP, PR, SC (WikiAves, 2016) and RS (Belton, 1985; Maur�cio et al., 2013). In RS, it is considered an austral migrant (Accordi & Hartz, 2013) � present from September to May (Belton, 1985) �, as well as in SC (WikiAves, 2016). In the region of Cama�ari/BA, both subspecies were recorded between May and August, and one individual of P. t. fusca banded in Cama�ari in May was recovered in Serra do Cara�a/MG in December, probably returning from the north (Vasconcelos et al., 2003). the nominotypical subspecies is resident and occurs from northern South America and Central America to the Amazonian region and northeastern Brazil. The subspecies P. t. fusca is migratory; breeds in eastern Bolivia, Argentina, southeastern and southern central Brazil; and migrates to northern South America and Panama. It gathers in large flocks of hundreds or thousands of individuals after the breeding season, and eventually joins other swallows (Turner, 2004). These populations reach Central America usually in large numbers, where they join resident populations of P. t. ta? pera (Sick, 1997). In Brazil, there is evidence of breeding"
261,Hirundinidae,Progne chalybea ,MPR:  ,andorinha-grande,Gray-breasted Martin,,," occurs from Mexico to northern Argentina and exhibits a migratory pattern in the south part of its distribution (Turner, 2004), where it is represented by the subspecies P. c. macrorhamphus (Grantsau, 2010). It begins nesting in RJ and MT in August-September, and departs from southern and central Brazil in the fall (March-May), when it migrates to the north of the continent, where there is a resident Amazonian population (P. c. chalybea). Large flocks have been recorded in ES (February), AM (July) and MT (October) (Sick, 1997). In RS, it breeds from October to December (Belton, 1985; Maur�cio et al., 2013; WikiAves, 2016) where it is considered migratory (Accordi & Hartz, 2013). According to photographic records, there is also evidence of breeding activity in the Amazon and in the Southeast and South regions. In addition, it is present in SP, PR, SC and RS all year round (WikiAves, 2016), which suggests a need for further studies to confirm if only part of its population is migratory."
262,Hirundinidae,Petrochelidon pyrrhonota ,MPR:  ,andorinha-de-dorso-acanelado,Cliff Swallow,,," breeds in North America between late April and early August, and remains during boreal winter in South America, gathering in flocks that can reach thousands of birds. Individuals depart from their colonies between July and September, reach South America between October and December and return between February and April (Turner, 2004). Specimens banded as chicks in the USA in June were recovered in SC and SP in Brazil in January (Sick, 1997), which confirms that the Southeast and South regions of Brazil are wintering areas. In Bras�lia/DF, it is extremely localized when passing through to the south in early October (Antas, 1987). In the region of Itirapina/SP, it has been recorded from late October to November, including in large numbers (around 850 individuals) in 1992 (Willis, 2004). In RS, it has been recorded from September to April (Belton, 1985), and there seems to be a recently established breeding population in the southeast of the Pampas in South America (Azpiroz et al., 2012). Photographic records in Brazil are centered in the period between October and April (WikiAves, 2016), which confirms the known migratory pattern."
263,Turdidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
264,Turdidae,Turdus amaurochalinus ,MPR:  ,sabi�-poca,Creamy-bellied Thrush,,," occurs in Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, central and northern Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and almost all of Brazil (Collar & Juana, 2015), but with few records for the Amazon. During austral winter, many individuals fly northwards, and flocks fly over RJ in late April and early May, reaching MA and eastern PA (Sick,  1997) mainly between June and October. The large number of individuals of this species in the southeast coast of Brazil between June and July may be because of immigrants coming from regions further south (Collar & Juana, 2015). During migration, a large number of individuals from southern population cross the marshes east of Tucum�n and west of Santiago del Estero in Argentina to Bolivia and Peru between May and June. Another part of the migration occurs east going up along the Atlantic coast to northeastern Brazil. The return migration in spring starts in October in northern Argentina. There is a population that is supposed to be resident in the convergence zone of the Paran� and Uruguay Rivers, in a large region of deltas and marshes in the provinces of Entre R�os and Buenos Aires (Capllonch et al., 2008). The species breed in multiple localities � CE, MS, GO, MG, RJ, SP, PR, RS � in Brazil (WikiAves, 2016; Maur�cio et al., 2013). Photographic and museum records document its presence mainly from September to January in southeastern and southern regions, while in central-western and northeastern Brazil they seem to be irregularly spread throughout the year (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MNRJ; MPEG). Although these records do not suggest a migratory pattern probably due to the coexistence of resident and migratory populations, banding and recovery data confirms is movement between the south of the country and RJ in January and June respectively (SNA, 2016)."
267,Turdidae,Turdus subalaris ,MPR:  ,sabi�-ferreiro,Eastern Slaty Thrush,,," occurs in Paraguay, Argentina and central-western, southeastern and southern regions of Brazil (Collar, 2016). The cis-andean population is migratory, breeds in southern Brazil, Argentina and the border with Paraguay, and seems to overwinter in the eastern part of the Cerrado/Amazon transition, flying over Bras�lia/DF between September and October (Antas & Valle, 1987; Ferreira & Bagno, 2000; WikiAves, 2016). In addition, there are records for PA (Somenzari et al., 2011), TO (Pinheiro et al., 2008), RJ (Pacheco et al., 2010), MT, GO, BA, MG, SP, PR, SC and RS (Grantsau, 2010). In SC and RS, it has been recorded in large numbers from September to April and there is also evidence of breeding activity (Belton, 1985; Maur�cio et al., 2013). Museum records are centered in the period of April-September in the states of PA, TO, MT, GO, BA, SP and SC (MZUSP; MPEG)."
268,Motacillidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
269,Motacillidae,Anthus correndera ,MPR:  ,caminheiro-de-espora,Correndera Pipit,,," occurs in Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil. The Brazilian subspecies A. c. correndera occurs in southern Paraguay, northern Argentina, Uruguay and extreme southern Brazil (Tyler, 2004). In Brazil, there are records for RS throughout the year, where it breeds (Belton, 1985; Maur�cio et al., 2013), and for SC in June, September and October (Azevedo & Ghizoni-Jr., 2005; WikiAves, 2016)."
270,Thraupidae,,MPR:  ,,,,,
271,Thraupidae,Tangara peruviana ,MPR:  ,sa�ra-sapucaia,Black-backed Tanager,VU,VU," is endemic to southern and southeastern Brazil in the Atlantic Forest. During austral winter, it migrates to RJ and ES (Hilty, 2011), as corroborated by photographic records (WikiAves, 2016) and banding data (SNA, 2016). Records for these states are centered in the period between April and September, while those for SP, PR and SC are in all months of the year, which suggests that part of the population is resident. Sparse records in May, August and September for RS and one localized record for BA in July seem to confirm the austral migration. In addition, there is also evidence of breeding activity in SP and PR (WikiAves, 2016)."
272,Thraupidae,Tersina viridis ,MPR:  ,sa�-andorinha,Swallow Tanager,,," occurs from Panama to eastern Brazil and northeastern Argentina, represented by resident populations as well as migratory populations that move short distances. Populations from the extreme south of the distribution (northern Argentina and southern Brazil) are migratory and fly north during austral winter (Hilty, 2011). In Brazil, it is present in RS only between September and April (Belton, 1985) and there are records of breeding activity in lowland Atlantic Forest areas in SP between September and March, which suggests that the species leaves this region between April and August (Aleixo & Galetti, 1997). Groups of 100 individuals or more have been reported between March and August in MG (Hilty, 2011). In the region of Garanhuns/PE, the species can be observed from May to September, which coincides with mistletoe fructification (W. Telino-J�nior, pers. obs.) and with the hypothesis of migration north during austral winter. In the region of Alter do Ch�o/PA, it is recorded only during the rainy season between January and June (Sanaiotti & Cintra, 2001). Photographic records (WikiAves, 2016) and banding data (SNA, 2016) do not confirm such patterns available in the literature, but in GO, MG, SP, PR, SC and RS the species presents breeding activity (September-December) related to the elevation: most records (78% or 18 out of 23) are from localities with an elevation of over 600 m. Breeding data from lower elevations need to be confirmed by the respective authors, because they may have been obtained in areas that are higher than the altitude of the center of the municipality (which is the available coordinate). The same altitudinal pattern has been observed for most of the young (72% or 8 out of 11) remaining over 600 m even though their records were more dispersed during the year. In the Amazon, its presence seems to be distributed in the months of the year, which suggests a pattern of regular occurrence, even though there are no records of breeding activity (WikiAves, 2016). This way, the species was classified as partially migratory due to its tendency of altitudinal restriction in breeding activity of the Atlantic Forest population and it needs to be studied further."
273,Thraupidae,Dacnis nigripes ,MPR:  ,sa�-de-pernas-pretas,Black-legged Dacnis,NT,," is endemic to Brazil and occurs in coastal areas in the southeast from BA to SC. It is an altitudinal migrant that can roam widely in its distribution (Hilty, 2011) as reported for the region of Mag�/RJ (Gonzaga, 1983), where flocks were recorded at sea level during winter (Sick, 1997). Photographic records of breeding activity are restricted to the period between November and February in localities over 600 m high in SP, which suggests that the species tends to occupy higher elevations during the breeding season and that it moves to lower areas in all other months (from March to October). However, this pattern is not observed in other states in which the species occurs, perhaps as a reflection of poor sampling. In RJ, records are centered in the period between March and September (MPEG; MNRJ; WikiAves, 2016) without an apparent altitudinal pattern. In SC and RS, records have elevations lower than 400 m and are centered in the period between June and January (WikiAves, 2016)."
274,Thraupidae,Sporophila lineola ,MPR:  ,bigodinho,Lined Seedeater,,," occurs in Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Argentina and Brazil and there are two different populations. The first one occurs in the south and nests in southeastern Brazil, northern Argentina and Paraguay between November and February, crosses through Central Brazil and Eastern Bolivia and reaches central and western Amazonia, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia between May-June and September-October. The other breeds in the Caatinga region between January and MayJune, migrates to the region of the Llanos in Venezuela and the Guianas through eastern PA and Suriname from June to December, apparently determined by the rainfall regime. Despite these patterns, the species is recorded during almost the entire year in central and western Amazonia (Silva, 1995, 1999; D�Angelo-Neto & Vasconcelos, 2007) and it is not clear whether this is a resident population or individuals from different populations that visit this area at different times (Jaramillo & Kirwan, 2015). Photographic records are distributed in all months of the year (WikiAves, 2016). The migratory pattern in the Caatinga is corroborated by data from WikiAves: records are centered in the period between December and June. In RS, the few available records are centered in the period between December and May (WikiAves, 2016) and there is evidence of breeding activity (Maur�cio et al., 2013). There is also a possibility that there is a resident population in the Amazon, so the species was classified as partially migratory and further studies are necessary to confirm these patterns."
275,Thraupidae,Sporophila caerulescens ,MPR:  ,coleirinho,Double-collared Seedeater,,," occurs in Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay and almost all of Brazil. Its movement pattern is not fully understood. Some populations are resident, while the ones further south of its distribution migrate north during winter and are recorded only seasonally in some areas such as eastern Peru and Central Brazil (Jaramillo, 2011a). In Argentina, large numbers of males are captured alone in November and December. It has been suggested that they leave first for winter migration north in February, since only females and their young that had yet to molt into full adult plumage were observed in the end of summer and beginning of fall. Populations from northeastern and northwestern Argentina are also peculiar: they migrate in different directions and for different distances (Ortiz & Capllonch, 2007). In Brazil, the species flies over the Pantanal when moving from the south to the north of the country especially in April, as well as when returning south in  September (Sick, 1997). However, photographic records for the Pantanal show its presence in MT between May and December and in MS from April to November and in February (WikiAves, 2016). In RS, most individuals seem to disappear during winter (Belton, 1985). There is evidence of breeding activity between September and May and it is restricted to GO and other states from the Southeast and South (Belton, 1985; Maur�cio et al., 2013; WikiAves, 2016), which suggests that the species is partially migratory. Further studies are still necessary to fully comprehend its movements."
276,Thraupidae,Sporophila bouvreuil ,MPR:  ,caboclinho,Copper Seedeater,,," occurs in Suriname and Brazil, from AP to northeastern SP (Machado & Silveira, 2010). It is resident in most of its distribution, but migratory in the south (Rising, 2011). Populations that breed in the Amazon seem to fly to the Cerrado or Caatinga, where they join resident populations that breed in these dominions and probably migrate only short distances. In the Atlantic Forest, part of the population is resident and remains all year round in this biome (Machado & Silveira, 2010). This species has been observed as part of flocks of over 1,000 individuals foraging in pastures in the Araguaia River Basin in southeastern PA, as reported in mid-September 2009, 2010 and 2013 (Cavarzere et al., 2015)."
277,Thraupidae,Sporophila hypoxantha ,MPR:  ,caboclinho-de-barriga-vermelha,Tawny-bellied Seedeater,,VU," occurs in eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, northeastern Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil (Grantsau, 2010). Four populations were recently identified based on vocalizations (dialects): two of them are resident, one is partially migratory, and another completely migratory. It moves between Corrientes and Entre R�os in Argentina and southern Brazil, where it breeds from mid-October/November to March/April (Areta & Repenning, 2011). The movement pattern of this species in Brazil is not fully understood, but it is known that populations move to the north and center of its distribution (SP, MG, GO, MT and MS) after the breeding season, where they join other Sporophila species (Machado, 2009). This species has been observed in interspecific flocks together with their Amazonian and Central Brazilian congeners (Sick, 1997), and composing mixed flocks � mainly represented by Sporophila bouvreuil � foraging in pastures in the Araguaia River basin in southeastern PA in mid-September 2009, 2010 and 2013 (Cavarzere et al., 2015). The most northern limit of its wintering grounds is southeastern PA (Somenzari et al., 2011) and TO (Dornas et al., 2013). In PR, it performs migratory movements and there are more individuals during spring and summer, even though there are other resident individuals all year round in this state (Straube et al., 2004), as well as breeding populations. Banding data shows the species in SC from November to March, and in RS in December and January (SNA, 2016), but there is also evidence of breeding activity in April and November (Belton, 1985)."
278,Thraupidae,Sporophila ruficollis ,MPR:  ,caboclinho-de-papo-escuro,Dark-throated Seedeater,NT,VU," occurs in northern and eastern Bolivia, western and central Paraguay, northern Argentina, northern and western Uruguay and Brazil (Jaramillo, 2011b). It arrives on the breeding site in late November and remains there until December; a large part of the population overwinters in the Cerrado in MT and in other hotter, more humid regions on the continent (Jaramillo, 2011b; Azpiroz et al., 2012). In Brazil, it breeds only in a restricted area on the western border of RS (FZBRS, 2013). It has been observed in interspecific flocks together with their Amazonian and Central Brazilian congeners (Sick, 1997) and composing mixed flocks � mainly represented by Sporophila bouvreuil � foraging in pastures in the Araguaia River basin in southeastern PA in mid-September 2009, 2010 and 2013 (Cavarzere et al., 2015). For southeastern PA and southern TO, there are also records in July, August and September (Somenzari et al., 2011; Dornas et al., 2013; MZUSP). Photographic records show a sparse presence of this species for AM, RO, MT, MS, GO, ES, SP, PR and RS between August and April (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MPEG), and also an influx of individuals that come from outside Brazil in the winter (FZBRS, 2013). Records for AM in September and November contradict the migratory pattern described in the literature, since the species is expected to be restricted to its breeding area (RS) during this time, which allows us to assume the existence of a resident population for this species. Because of this, further studies are necessary to unveil its movements and properly delimit its breeding grounds."

282,Cardinalidae,Cyanoloxia glaucocaerulea ,MPR:  ,azulinho,Glaucous-blue Grosbeak,,," breeds south of the Tropic of Capricorn in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil, northeastern Argentina, and northern, eastern and western Uruguay (Brewer, 2011), and migrates north during winter (Chesser, 1994). In Brazil, it occurs in MS and from SP to RS (Grantsau, 2010). In SC, PR and RS, it is present all year round, but in MT (Pelzeln, 1870), MS, MG (Sick, 1997; MZUSP), GO, ES (WikiAves, 2016) and RJ (Mallet-Rodrigues, 2003), records are restricted to the winter between May and October. In SP, although there are records in February, April and November, most records are centered in the winter (WikiAves, 2016), which confirms its migratory pattern."
401,Phoenicopteridae,, ND: ,,,,,
402,Phoenicopteridae,Phoenicopterus ruber, ND: ,flamingo,American Flamingo,,,"occurs in the Caribbean, Gal�pagos and northern South America (del Hoyo, 1992). Despite historic reports of breeding colonies on Maraj� Island/Par� (PA) and Lago Piratuba/southern Amap� (AP) (Sick, 1969), there are no current records of it breeding in the country (Nascimento et al., 1992). In the area between the lighthouse at Cape Orange and the mouth of the Oyapock River, groups of 600 and 350 individuals have been recorded respectively in November 1991 and May 1992 (Nascimento et al., 1992). In the same region, around 90 individuals have been recorded in April 2014 and another small group in February 2015 (WikiAves, 2016). One adult has also been recorded in Galinhos/Rio Grande do Norte (RN) between January and March 2001 (Azevedo-J�nior et al., 2004) and one specimen collected in Cear� (CE) (Oren, 1991). Museum records are restricted to AP in August and in PA in February and December (MPEG). This suggests that its occurrence in Brazil is due to irregular movements that originate in the north of the distribution of the species and that further studies are necessary to confirm its migratory pattern."
403,Rallidae,, ND: ,,,,,
404,Rallidae,Porphyrio flavirostris, ND: ,frango-d'�gua-pequeno,Azure Gallinule,,,"occurs from eastern Colombia through southern central Venezuela to the Guianas, south as far as eastern Ecuador, northern and southeastern Peru, northern Bolivia, and central Paraguay to extreme northern Argentina, and there are also sparse records in the entire Brazil (Taylor, 1996). Its occurrence is highly seasonal in parts of its distribution and it seems to coincide with the flood season: in southwestern Amazon and Paraguay, it occurs mainly between October and January; in eastern Amazon, between February and August; in western Amazon, records peak in January; and in the Upper Amazon, it is present only between January and July. It is consideredVAGrant in southern Brazil (Remsen Jr. & Parker III, 1990; Taylor, 1996; Dias et al., 2010b). Photographic records do not corroborate the pattern described in the literature. The occurrence of this species in the South region is restricted to sporadic records for all three states (Dias et al., 2010b; Meyer, 2015). More data is necessary to classify this species as migratory. Individuals collected in Fazenda Fartura in Santana do Araguaia/PA had developed gonads, which indicates that the species breeds in Brazil (L.F. Silveira, pers. obs.). Museum collection data are restricted to MT in May and in PA in March, April, August, November and December (MPEG)."
405,Cuculidae,, ND: ,,,,,
406,Cuculidae,Coccyzus erythropthalmus, ND: ,papa-lagarta-de-bico-preto,Black-billed Cuckoo,,,"breeds in Canada and the USA; overwinters in northwestern and central western South America (Payne, 1997). In Brazil, it was recorded only in western Acre (AC) in February (Whittaker & Oren, 1999, MPEG 48047 [AC, 1992, Feb]) and in AP in November (Xavier & Boss, 2011), which suggests that the country could be a wintering area. However, its occurrence may be incidental and further studies are necessary to classify it as migratory."
407,Columbidae,, ND: ,,,,,
408,Columbidae,Zenaida auriculata, ND: ,avoante,Eared Dove,,,"out of the four subspecies that occur in Brazil, Z. a. noronha occurs in the semiarid Caatinga in the Northeast region and presents large population variations because of flock gatherings during the rainy season while searching for breeding sites, where it forms breeding colonies with thousands of nests (Azevedo-J�nior & Antas, 1990). It seems to breed itinerantly in the Northeast (Bucher, 1982), which is corroborated by banding data from up to 2005 (SNA, 2016). According to this pattern, the first colonies appeared around the middle of the S�o Francisco River in Bahia (BA) between February and March. The species appeared soon after in western Pernambuco (PE), southern CE and southwestern Piau� (PI) and then, between May and June, in southern central PE (Sert�o do Paje�), Serid� region (on the border between PB and RN) and RN (Azevedo-J�nior & Antas, 1990). However, there is an annual change in total precipitation in the Caatinga that may favor the opportunist occurrence of colonies in places they do not usually occur in years of irregular precipitation (Azevedo-J�nior & Antas, 1990). The species has been classified as migratory (except for in Fernando de Noronha/PE, where it is resident) because it moves in response to rain movements in the Caatinga (Antas, 1987; Azevedo-J�nior & Antas, 1990; Souza et al., 2007), slowly flying from the southwest to the northeast (Nimer, 1977). However, Sick (1983) states that it is not every year that this species gathers by the thousands in the Northeast, and this, when associated to the fact that it can be observed in the Northeast during the entire year (WikiAves, 2016) without a clear seasonal population fluctuation, conflicts with its classification as migratory. For this reason, the species is here classified as not defined."
409,Apodidae,, ND: ,,,,,
410,Apodidae,Chaetura pelagica, ND: ,,,,,"has been classified as a Neotropical migrant (Allen & Connor, 2000). It breeds in North America and overwinters in Ecuador, Peru, northern Chile and possibly northwestern Brazil (Chantler, 1999). Stotz et al. (1992) discuss difficulties in confirming alleged records of this species for the Manaus region/ Amazonas (AM). Undocumented flocks of this species have been seen in four different dates and they originated in western AC (Whittaker & Oren, 1999)."
411,Tyrannidae,, ND: ,,,,,
412,Tyrannidae,Phaeomyias murina, ND: ,bagageiro,Mouse-colored Tyrannulet,,,"occurs from Panama to eastern Brazil and northwestern Argentina. Populations from the south of the distribution (Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay) seem to migrate north and winter in the Amazon Basin (Fitzpatrick, 2004). In Brazil, it occurs year round except for PR where the records are restricted to the period of September to January (WikiAves, 2016; MZUSP; MNRJ; MPEG). However, data is still insufficient to determine a migratory pattern and further studies are necessary."
413,Tyrannidae,Myiodynastes luteiventris, ND: ,bem-te-vi-de-barriga-sulf�rea,Sulphur-bellied Flycatcher,,,"breeds from southwestern USA, Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize south as far as Costa Rica.
