# brazilian_bird_classification
1. Process the data using data.preprocessing.py
2. Train the data using train_model.py
3. Evaluate the data using evaluate_model.py

At each and every step there processed, trained data will be stored in the .pkl file

 This Repo demonstrates the working of how you can predict, which bird is native to to the place and which is migratory using machine learning.

There are three python-files first is data_processing.py second is train.py and in the end, evaluate.py.

you can fork this repo and the dataset used is Brazilian-bird data.
Do star this repo if you like.
